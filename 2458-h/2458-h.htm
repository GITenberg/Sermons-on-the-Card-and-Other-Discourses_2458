<h1>SERMONS ON THE CARD AND OTHER DISCOURSES<br />
by Hugh Latimer</h1>
<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p>Hugh Latimer, a farmer&rsquo;s son, was born about the year 1491,
at Thurcaston, in Leicestershire.&nbsp; He was an only son, with six
sisters, who were all well cared for at home.&nbsp; He was a boy of
fourteen when sent to Clare College, Cambridge.&nbsp; When about twenty-four
years old, he had obtained a college fellowship, had taken the degree
of Master of Arts, and was ordained Priest of the Roman Church at Lincoln.&nbsp;
In 1524, at the age of about thirty, he proceeded to the degree of B.D.,
and on the occasion of his doing so he argued publicly for the Pope&rsquo;s
authority against opinions of Melancthon.&nbsp; Thomas Bilney went afterwards
to Latimer&rsquo;s rooms, gave him his own reasons for good-will to
the teaching of Melancthon, and explained to him his faith as a Reformer
in a way that secured Latimer&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; Latimer&rsquo;s
free, vigorous mind, admitted the new reasonings, and in his after-life
he looked always upon &ldquo;little Bilney&rdquo; as the man who had
first opened his eyes.</p>
<p>With homely earnestness Latimer began soon to express his new convictions.&nbsp;
His zeal and purity of life had caused him to be trusted by the University
as a maintainer of old ways; he had been appointed cross-bearer to the
University, and elected one of the twelve preachers annually appointed
in obedience to a bull of Pope Alexander VI.&nbsp; Now Latimer walked
and worked with Bilney, visiting the sick and the prisoners, and reasoning
together of the needs of Christendom.&nbsp; The Bishop of the diocese
presently forbade Latimer&rsquo;s preaching in any of the pulpits of
the University.&nbsp; Robert Barnes, prior of the Augustinian Friars
at Cambridge, a man stirred to the depths by the new movement of thought,
then invited Latimer to preach in the church of the Augustinians.&nbsp;
Latimer was next summoned before Wolsey, whom he satisfied so well that
Wolsey overruled the Bishop&rsquo;s inhibition, and Latimer again became
a free preacher in Cambridge.</p>
<p>The influence of Latimer&rsquo;s preaching became every year greater;
and in December, 1529, he gave occasion to new controversy in the University
by his two Sermons on the Card, delivered in St. Edward&rsquo;s Church,
on the Sunday before Christmas, 1529.&nbsp; Card-playing was in those
days an amusement especially favoured at Christmas time.&nbsp; Latimer
does not express disapproval, though the Reformers generally were opposed
to it.&nbsp; The early statutes of St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge,
forbade playing with dice or cards by members of the college at any
time except Christmas, but excluded undergraduates even from the Christmas
privilege.&nbsp; In these sermons Latimer used the card-playing of the
season for illustrations of spiritual truth drawn from the trump card
in triumph, and the rules of the game of primero.&nbsp; His homely parables
enforced views of religious duty more in accordance with the mind of
the Reformers than of those who held by the old ways.&nbsp; The Prior
of the Dominicans at Cambridge tried to answer Latimer&rsquo;s sermon
on the cards with an antagonistic sermon on the dice: the orthodox Christian
was to win by a throw of cinque and quatre&mdash;the cinque, five texts
to be quoted against Luther; and the quatre the four great doctors of
the Church.&nbsp; Latimer replied with vigour; others ranged themselves
on one side or the other, and there was general battle in the University;
but the King&rsquo;s Almoner soon intervened with a letter commanding
silence on both sides till the King&rsquo;s pleasure was further declared.&nbsp;
The King&rsquo;s good-will to Latimer was due, as the letter indicated,
to the understanding that Latimer &ldquo;favoured the King&rsquo;s cause&rdquo;
in the question of divorce from Katherine of Arragon.</p>
<p>In March, 1530, Latimer was called to preach before Henry VIII.,
at Windsor.&nbsp; The King then made Latimer his chaplain, and in the
following year gave him the rectory of West Kington, in Wiltshire.&nbsp;
The new rector, soon accused of heresy, was summoned before the Bishop
of London and before Convocation; was excommunicated and imprisoned,
and absolved by special request of the King.&nbsp; When Cranmer became
Archbishop of Canterbury, Latimer returned into royal favour, and preached
before the King on Wednesdays in Lent.&nbsp; In 1535, when an Italian
nominee of the Pope&rsquo;s was deprived of the Bishopric of Worcester,
Latimer was made his successor; but resigned in 1539, when the King,
having virtually made himself Pope, dictated to a tractable parliament
enforcement of old doctrines by an Act for Abolishing Diversity of Opinion.&nbsp;
From that time until the death of Henry VIII. Latimer was in disgrace.</p>
<p>The accession of Edward VI. brought him again to the front, and the
Sermon on the Plough, in this volume, is a famous example of his use
of his power under Edward VI., as the greatest preacher of his time,
in forwarding the Reformation of the Church, and of the lives of those
who professed and called themselves Christians.&nbsp; The rest of his
story will be associated in another volume of this Library with a collection
of his later sermons.</p>

<h2>SERMONS ON THE CARD.</h2>
<h3>THE TENOR AND EFFECT OF CERTAIN SERMONS MADE BY MASTER LATIMER IN
CAMBRIDGE, ABOUT THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1529.</h3>
<p><i>Tu quis es</i>?&nbsp; Which words are as much to say in English,
&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; These be the words of the Pharisees,
which were sent by the Jews unto St. John Baptist in the wilderness,
to have knowledge of him who he was: which words they spake unto him
of an evil intent, thinking that he would have taken on him to be Christ,
and so they would have had him done with their good wills, because they
knew that he was more carnal, and given to their laws, than Christ indeed
should be, as they perceived by their old prophecies; and also, because
they marvelled much of his great doctrine, preaching, and baptizing,
they were in doubt whether he was Christ or not: wherefore they said
unto him, &ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then answered St. John,
and confessed that he was not Christ.</p>
<p>Now here is to be noted the great and prudent answer of St. John
Baptist unto the Pharisees, that when they required of him who he was,
he would not directly answer of himself what he was himself, but he
said he was not Christ: by the which saying he thought to put the Jews
and Pharisees out of their false opinion and belief towards him, in
that they would have had him to exercise the office of Christ; and so
declared further unto them of Christ, saying, &ldquo;He is in the midst
of you and amongst you, whom ye know not, whose latchet of his shoe
I am not worthy to unloose, or undo.&rdquo;&nbsp; By this you may perceive
that St. John spake much in the laud and praise of Christ his Master,
professing himself to be in no wise like unto him.&nbsp; So likewise
it shall be necessary unto all men and women of this world, not to ascribe
unto themselves any goodness of themselves, but all unto our Lord God,
as shall appear hereafter, when this question aforesaid, &ldquo;Who
art thou?&rdquo; shall be moved unto them: not as the Pharisees did
unto St. John, of an evil purpose, but of a good and simple mind, as
may appear hereafter.</p>
<p>Now then, according to the preacher&rsquo;s mind, let every man and
woman, of a good and simple mind, contrary to the Pharisees&rsquo; intent,
ask this question, &ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; This question must
be moved to themselves, what they be of themselves, on this fashion:
&ldquo;What art thou of thy only and natural generation between father
and mother, when thou camest into this world?&nbsp; What substance,
what virtue, what goodness art thou of, by thyself?&rdquo;&nbsp; Which
question if thou rehearse oftentimes unto thyself, thou shalt well perceive
and understand how thou shalt make answer unto it; which must be made
on this wise: I am of myself, and by myself, coming from my natural
father and mother, the child of the ire and indignation of God, the
true inheritor of hell, a lump of sin, and working nothing of myself
but all towards hell, except I have better help of another than I have
of myself.&nbsp; Now we may see in what state we enter into this world,
that we be of ourselves the true and just inheritors of hell, the children
of the ire and indignation of Christ, working all towards hell, whereby
we deserve of ourselves perpetual damnation, by the right judgment of
God, and the true claim of ourselves; which unthrifty state that we
be born unto is come unto us for our own deserts, as proveth well this
example following:</p>
<p>Let it be admitted for the probation of this, that it might please
the king&rsquo;s grace now being to accept into his favour a mean man,
of a simple degree and birth, not born to any possession; whom the king&rsquo;s
grace favoureth, not because this person hath of himself deserved any
such favour, but that the king casteth this favour unto him of his own
mere motion and fantasy: and for because the king&rsquo;s grace will
more declare his favour unto him, he giveth unto this said man a thousand
pounds in lands, to him and his heirs, on this condition, that he shall
take upon him to be the chief captain and defender of his town of Calais,
and to be true and faithful to him in the custody of the same, against
the Frenchmen especially, above all other enemies.</p>
<p>This man taketh on him this charge, promising his fidelity thereunto.&nbsp;
It chanceth in process of time, that by the singular acquaintance and
frequent familiarity of this captain with the Frenchmen, these Frenchmen
give unto the said captain of Calais a great sum of money, so that he
will but be content and agreeable that they may enter into the said
town of Calais by force of arms; and so thereby possess the same unto
the crown of France.&nbsp; Upon this agreement the Frenchmen do invade
the said town of Calais, alonely by the negligence of this captain.</p>
<p>Now the king&rsquo;s grace, hearing of this invasion, cometh with
a great puissance to defend this his said town, and so by good policy
of war overcometh the said Frenchmen, and entereth again into his said
town of Calais.&nbsp; Then he, being desirous to know how these enemies
of his came thither, maketh profound search and inquiry by whom this
treason was conspired.&nbsp; By this search it was known and found his
own captain to be the very author and the beginner of the betraying
of it.&nbsp; The king, seeing the great infidelity of this person, dischargeth
this man of his office, and taketh from him and from his heirs this
thousand pounds of possessions.&nbsp; Think you not that the king doth
use justice unto him, and all his posterity and heirs?&nbsp; Yes, truly:
the said captain cannot deny himself but that he had true justice, considering
how unfaithfully he behaved him to his prince, contrary to his own fidelity
and promise.&nbsp; So likewise it was of our first father Adam.&nbsp;
He had given unto him the spirit of science and knowledge, to work all
goodness therewith: this said spirit was not given alonely unto him,
but unto all his heirs and posterity.&nbsp; He had also delivered him
the town of Calais; that is to say, paradise in earth, the most strong
and fairest town in the world, to be in his custody.&nbsp; He nevertheless,
by the instigation of these Frenchmen, that is to say, the temptation
of the fiend, did obey unto their desire; and so he brake his promise
and fidelity, the commandment of the everlasting King his master, in
eating of the apple by him inhibited.</p>
<p>Now then the King, seeing this great treason in his captain, deposed
him of the thousand pounds of possessions, that is to say, from everlasting
life in glory, and all his heirs and posterity: for likewise as he had
the spirit of science and knowledge, for him and his heirs; so in like
manner, when he lost the same, his heirs also lost it by him and in
him.&nbsp; So now this example proveth, that by our father Adam we had
once in him the very inheritance of everlasting joy; and by him, and
in him, again we lost the same.</p>
<p>The heirs of the captain of Calais could not by any manner of claim
ask of the king the right and title of their father in the thousand
pounds of possessions, by reason the king might answer and say unto
them, that although their father deserved not of himself to enjoy so
great possessions, yet he deserved by himself to lose them, and greater,
committing so high treason, as he did, against his prince&rsquo;s commandments;
whereby he had no wrong to lose his title, but was unworthy to have
the same, and had therein true justice.&nbsp; Let not you think, which
be his heirs, that if he had justice to lose his possessions, you have
wrong to lose the same.&nbsp; In the same manner it may be answered
unto all men and women now being, that if our father Adam had true justice
to be excluded from his possession of everlasting glory in paradise,
let us not think the contrary that be his heirs, but that we have no
wrong in losing also the same; yea, we have true justice and right.&nbsp;
Then in what miserable estate we be, that of the right and just title
of our own deserts have lost the everlasting joy, and claim of ourselves
to be true inheritors of hell!&nbsp; For he that committeth deadly sin
willingly, bindeth himself to be inheritor of everlasting pain: and
so did our forefather Adam willingly eat of the apple forbidden.&nbsp;
Wherefore he was cast out of the everlasting joy in paradise into this
corrupt world, amongst all vileness, whereby of himself he was not worthy
to do any thing laudable or pleasant to God, evermore bound to corrupt
affections and beastly appetites, transformed into the most uncleanest
and variablest nature that was made under heaven; of whose seed and
disposition all the world is lineally descended, insomuch that this
evil nature is so fused and shed from one into another, that at this
day there is no man nor woman living that can of themselves wash away
this abominable vileness: and so we must needs grant of ourselves to
be in like displeasure unto God, as our forefather Adam was.&nbsp; By
reason hereof as I said, we be of ourselves the very children of the
indignation and vengeance of God, the true inheritors of hell, and working
all towards hell: which is the answer to this question, made to every
man and woman, by themselves, &ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now, the world standing in this damnable state, cometh in the
occasion of the incarnation of Christ.&nbsp; The Father in heaven, perceiving
the frail nature of man, that he, by himself and of himself, could do
nothing for himself, by his prudent wisdom sent down the second person
in Trinity, his Son Jesus Christ, to declare unto man his pleasure and
commandment: and so, at the Father&rsquo;s will, Christ took on him
human nature, being willing to deliver man out of this miserable way,
and was content to suffer cruel passion in shedding his blood for all
mankind; and so left behind for our safeguard laws and ordinances, to
keep us always in the right path unto everlasting life, as the evangelists,
the sacraments, the commandments, and so forth: which, if we do keep
and observe according to our profession, we shall answer better unto
this question, &ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo; than we did before.&nbsp;
For before thou didst enter into the sacrament of baptism, thou wert
but a natural man, a natural woman; as I might say, a man, a woman:
but after thou takest on thee Christ&rsquo;s religion, thou hast a longer
name; for then thou art a christian man, a christian woman.&nbsp; Now
then, seeing thou art a christian man, what shall be thy answer of this
question, &ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer of this question is, when I ask it unto myself, I must
say that I am a christian man, a christian woman, the child of everlasting
joy, through the merits of the bitter passion of Christ.&nbsp; This
is a joyful answer.&nbsp; Here we may see how much we be bound and in
danger unto God, that hath revived us from death to life, and saved
us that were damned: which great benefit we cannot well consider, unless
we do remember what we were of ourselves before we meddled with him
or his laws; and the more we know our feeble nature, and set less by
it, the more we shall conceive and know in our hearts what God hath
done for us; and the more we know what God hath done for us, the less
we shall set by ourselves, and the more we shall love and please God:
so that in no condition we shall either know ourselves or God, except
we do utterly confess ourselves to be mere vileness and corruption.&nbsp;
Well, now it is come unto this point, that we be christian men, christian
women, I pray you what doth Christ require of a christian man, or of
a christian woman?&nbsp; Christ requireth nothing else of a christian
man or woman, but that they will observe his rule: for likewise as he
is a good Augustine friar that keepeth well St. Augustine&rsquo;s rule,
so is he a good christian man that keepeth well Christ&rsquo;s rule.</p>
<p>Now then, what is Christ&rsquo;s rule?&nbsp; Christ&rsquo;s rule
consisteth in many things, as in the commandments, and the works of
mercy, and so forth.&nbsp; And for because I cannot declare Christ&rsquo;s
rule unto you at one time, as it ought to be done, I will apply myself
according to your custom at this time of Christmas: I will, as I said,
declare unto you Christ&rsquo;s rule, but that shall be in Christ&rsquo;s
cards.&nbsp; And whereas you are wont to celebrate Christmas in playing
at cards, I intend, by God&rsquo;s grace, to deal unto you Christ&rsquo;s
cards, wherein you shall perceive Christ&rsquo;s rule.&nbsp; The game
that we will play at shall be called the triumph, which, if it be well
played at, he that dealeth shall win; the players shall likewise win;
and the standers and lookers upon shall do the same; insomuch that there
is no man that is willing to play at this triumph with these cards,
but they shall be all winners, and no losers.</p>
<p>Let therefore every christian man and woman play at these cards,
that they may have and obtain the triumph: you must mark also that the
triumph must apply to fetch home unto him all the other cards, whatsoever
suit they be of.&nbsp; Now then, take ye this first card, which must
appear and be shewed unto you as followeth: you have heard what was
spoken to men of the old law, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill; whosoever
shall kill shall be in danger of judgment: but I say unto you&rdquo;
of the new law, saith Christ, &ldquo;that whosoever is angry with his
neighbour, shall be in danger of judgment; and whosoever shall say unto
his neighbour, &lsquo;Raca,&rsquo; that is to say, brainless,&rdquo;
or any other like word of rebuking, &ldquo;shall be in danger of council;
and whosoever shall say unto his neighbour, &lsquo;Fool,&rsquo; shall
be in danger of hell-fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; This card was made and spoken
by Christ, as appeareth in the fifth chapter of St. Matthew.</p>
<p>Now it must be noted, that whosoever shall play with this card, must
first, before they play with it, know the strength and virtue of the
same: wherefore you must well note and mark terms, how they be spoken,
and to what purpose.&nbsp; Let us therefore read it once or twice, that
we may be the better acquainted with it.</p>
<p>Now behold and see, this card is divided into four parts: the first
part is one of the commandments that was given unto Moses in the old
law, before the coming of Christ; which commandment we of the new law
be bound to observe and keep, and it is one of our commandments.&nbsp;
The other three parts spoken by Christ be nothing else but expositions
unto the first part of this commandment: for in very effect all these
four parts be but one commandment, that is to say, &ldquo;Thou shalt
not kill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet nevertheless, the last three parts do shew
unto thee how many ways thou mayest kill thy neighbour contrary to this
commandment: yet, for all Christ&rsquo;s exposition in the three last
parts of this card, the terms be not open enough to thee that dost read
and hear them spoken.&nbsp; No doubt, the Jews understood Christ well
enough, when he spake to them these three last sentences; for he spake
unto them in their own natural terms and tongue.&nbsp; Wherefore, seeing
that these terms were natural terms of the Jews, it shall be necessary
to expound them, and compare them unto some like terms of our natural
speech, that we, in like manner, may understand Christ as well as the
Jews did.&nbsp; We will begin first with the first part of this card,
and then after, with the other three parts.&nbsp; You must therefore
understand that the Jews and the Pharisees of the old law, to whom this
first part, this commandment, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill,&rdquo; was
spoken, thought it sufficient and enough for their discharge, not to
kill with any manner of material weapon, as sword, dagger, or with any
such weapon; and they thought it no great fault whatsoever they said
or did by their neighbours, so that they did not harm or meddle with
their corporal bodies: which was a false opinion in them, as prove well
the three last other sentences following the first part of this card.</p>
<p>Now, as touching the three other sentences, you must note and take
heed, what difference is between these three manner of offences: to
be angry with your neighbour; to call your neighbour &ldquo;brainless,&rdquo;
or any such word of disdain; or to call your neighbour &ldquo;fool.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Whether these three manner of offences be of themselves more grievous
one than the other, it is to be opened unto you.&nbsp; Truly, as they
be of themselves divers offences, so they kill diversly, one more than
the other; as you shall perceive by the first of these three, and so
forth.&nbsp; A man which conceiveth against his neighbour or brother
ire or wrath in his mind, by some manner of occasion given unto him,
although he be angry in his mind against his said neighbour, he will
peradventure express his ire by no manner of sign, either in word or
deed: yet, nevertheless, he offendeth against God, and breaketh this
commandment in killing his own soul; and is therefore &ldquo;in danger
of judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, to the second part of these three: That man that is moved with
ire against his neighbour, and in his ire calleth his neighbour &ldquo;brainless,&rdquo;
or some other like word of displeasure; as a man might say in a fury,
&ldquo;I shall handle thee well enough;&rdquo; which words and countenances
do more represent and declare ire to be in this man, than in him that
was but angry, and spake no manner of word nor shewed any countenance
to declare his ire.&nbsp; Wherefore as he that so declareth his ire
either by word or countenance offendeth more against God, so he both
killeth his own soul, and doth that in him is to kill his neighbour&rsquo;s
soul in moving him unto ire, wherein he is faulty himself; and so this
man is &ldquo;in danger of council.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now to the third offence, and last of these three: That man that
calleth his neighbour &ldquo;fool,&rdquo; doth more declare his angry
mind toward him, than he that called his neighbour but &ldquo;brainless,&rdquo;
or any such words moving ire: for to call a man &ldquo;fool,&rdquo;
that word representeth more envy in a man than &ldquo;brainless&rdquo;
doth.&nbsp; Wherefore he doth most offend, because he doth most earnestly
with such words express his ire, and so he is &ldquo;in danger of hell-fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wherefore you may understand now, these three parts of this card
be three offences, and that one is more grievous to God than the other,
and that one killeth more the soul of man than the other.</p>
<p>Now peradventure there be some that will marvel, that Christ did
not declare this commandment by some greater faults of ire, than by
these which seem but small faults, as to be angry and speak nothing
of it, to declare it and to call a man &ldquo;brainless,&rdquo; and
to call his neighbour &ldquo;fool:&rdquo; truly these be the smallest
and the least faults that belong to ire, or to killing in ire.&nbsp;
Therefore beware how you offend in any kind of ire: seeing that the
smallest be damnable to offend in, see that you offend not in the greatest.&nbsp;
For Christ thought, if he might bring you from the smallest manner of
faults, and give you warning to avoid the least, he reckoned you would
not offend in the greatest and worst, as to call your neighbour thief,
whoreson, whore, drab, and so forth, into more blasphemous names; which
offences must needs have punishment in hell, considering how that Christ
hath appointed these three small faults to have three degrees of punishment
in hell, as appeareth by these three terms, judgment, council, and hell-fire.&nbsp;
These three terms do signify nothing else but three divers punishments
in hell, according to the offences.&nbsp; Judgment is less in degree
than council, therefore it signifieth a lesser pain in hell, and it
is ordained for him that is angry in his mind with his neighbour, and
doth express his malice neither by word nor countenance: council is
a less degree in hell than hell-fire, and is a greater degree in hell
than judgment; and it is ordained for him that calleth his neighbour
&ldquo;brainless,&rdquo; or any such word, that declareth his ire and
malice: wherefore it is more pain than judgment.&nbsp; Hell-fire is
more pain in hell than council or judgment, and it is ordained for him
that calleth his neighbour &ldquo;fool,&rdquo; by reason that in calling
his neighbour &ldquo;fool,&rdquo; he declareth more his malice, in that
it is an earnest word of ire: wherefore hell-fire is appointed for it;
that is, the most pain of the three punishments.</p>
<p>Now you have heard, that to these divers offences of ire and killing
be appointed punishments according to their degrees: for look as the
offence is, so shall the pain be: if the offence be great, the pain
shall be according; if it be less, there shall be less pain for it.&nbsp;
I would not now that you should think, because that here are but three
degrees of punishment spoken of, that there be no more in hell.&nbsp;
No doubt Christ spake of no more here but of these three degrees of
punishment, thinking they were sufficient, enough for example, whereby
we might understand that there be as divers and many pains as there
be offences: and so by these three offences, and these three punishments,
all other offences and punishments may be compared with another.&nbsp;
Yet I would satisfy your minds further in these three terms, of &ldquo;judgment,
council, and hell-fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereas you might say, What was
the cause that Christ declared more the pains of hell by these terms
than by any other terms?&nbsp; I told you afore that he knew well to
whom he spake them.&nbsp; These terms were natural and well known amongst
the Jews and the Pharisees: wherefore Christ taught them with their
own terms, to the intent they might understand the better his doctrine.&nbsp;
And these terms may be likened unto three terms which we have common
and usual amongst us, that is to say, the sessions of inquirance, the
sessions of deliverance, and the execution-day.&nbsp; Sessions of inquirance
is like unto judgment; for when sessions of inquiry is, then the judges
cause twelve men to give verdict of the felon&rsquo;s crime, whereby
he shall be judged to be indicted: sessions of deliverance is much like
council; for at sessions of deliverance the judges go among themselves
to council, to determine sentence against the felon: execution-day is
to be compared unto hell-fire; for the Jews had amongst themselves a
place of execution, named &ldquo;hell-fire:&rdquo; and surely when a
man goeth to his death, it is the greatest pain in this world.&nbsp;
Wherefore you may see that there are degrees in these our terms, as
there be in those terms.</p>
<p>These evil-disposed affections and sensualities in us are always
contrary to the rule of our salvation.&nbsp; What shall we do now or
imagine to thrust down these Turks and to subdue them?&nbsp; It is a
great ignominy and shame for a christian man to be bond and subject
unto a Turk: nay, it shall not be so; we will first cast a trump in
their way, and play with them at cards, who shall have the better.&nbsp;
Let us play therefore on this fashion with this card.&nbsp; Whensoever
it shall happen the foul passions and Turks to rise in our stomachs
against our brother or neighbour, either for unkind words, injuries,
or wrongs, which they have done unto us, contrary unto our mind; straightways
let us call unto our remembrance, and speak this question unto ourselves,
&ldquo;Who art thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; The answer is, &ldquo;I am a christian
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then further we must say to ourselves, &ldquo;What
requireth Christ of a christian man?&rdquo;&nbsp; Now turn up your trump,
your heart (hearts is trump, as I said before), and cast your trump,
your heart, on this card; and upon this card you shall learn what Christ
requireth of a christian man&mdash;not to be angry, nor moved to ire
against his neighbour, in mind, countenance, nor other ways, by word
or deed.&nbsp; Then take up this card with your heart, and lay them
together: that done, you have won the game of the Turk, whereby you
have defaced and overcome him by true and lawful play.&nbsp; But, alas
for pity! the Rhodes are won and overcome by these false Turks; the
strong castle Faith is decayed, so that I fear it is almost impossible
to win it again.</p>
<p>The great occasion of the loss of this Rhodes is by reason that christian
men do so daily kill their own nation, that the very true number of
Christianity is decayed; which murder and killing one of another is
increased specially two ways, to the utter undoing of Christendom, that
is to say, by example and silence.&nbsp; By example, as thus: when the
father, the mother, the lord, the lady, the master, the dame, be themselves
overcome by these Turks, they be continual swearers, avouterers, disposers
to malice, never in patience, and so forth in all other vices: think
you not, when the father, the mother, the master, the dame, be disposed
unto vice or impatience, but that their children and servants shall
incline and be disposed to the same?&nbsp; No doubt, as the child shall
take disposition natural of the father and mother, so shall the servants
apply unto the vices of their masters and dames: if the heads be false
in their faculties and crafts, it is no marvel if the children, servants,
and apprentices do joy therein.&nbsp; This is a great and shameful manner
of killing christian men, that the fathers, the mothers, the masters,
and the dames shall not alonely kill themselves, but all theirs, and
all that belongeth unto them: and so this way is a great number of christian
lineage murdered and spoiled.</p>
<p>The second manner of killing is silence.&nbsp; By silence also is
a great number of christian men slain; which is on this fashion: although
that the father and mother, master and dame, of themselves be well disposed
to live according to the law of God, yet they may kill their children
and servants in suffering them to do evil before their own faces, and
do not use due correction according unto their offences.&nbsp; The master
seeth his servant or apprentice take more of his neighbour than the
king&rsquo;s laws, or the order of his faculty, doth admit him; or that
he suffereth him to take more of his neighbour than he himself would
be content to pay, if he were in like condition: thus doing, I say,
such men kill willingly their children and servants, and shall go to
hell for so doing; but also their fathers and mothers, masters and dames,
shall bear them company for so suffering them.</p>
<p>Wherefore I exhort all true christian men and women to give good
example unto your children and servants, and suffer not them by silence
to offend.&nbsp; Every man must be in his own house, according to St.
Augustine&rsquo;s mind, a bishop, not alonely giving good ensample,
but teaching according to it, rebuking and punishing vice; not suffering
your children and servants to forget the laws of God.&nbsp; You ought
to see them have their belief, to know the commandments of God, to keep
their holy-days, not to lose their time in idleness: if they do so,
you shall all suffer pain for it, if God be true of his saying, as there
is no doubt thereof.&nbsp; And so you may perceive that there be many
a one that breaketh this card, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill,&rdquo; and
playeth therewith oftentime at the blind trump, whereby they be no winners,
but great losers.&nbsp; But who be those now-a-days that can clear themselves
of these manifest murders used to their children and servants?&nbsp;
I think not the contrary, but that many have these two ways slain their
own children unto their damnation; unless the great mercy of God were
ready to help them when they repent there-for.</p>
<p>Wherefore, considering that we be so prone and ready to continue
in sin, let us cast down ourselves with Mary Magdalene; and the more
we bow down with her toward Christ&rsquo;s feet, the more we shall be
afraid to rise again in sin; and the more we know and submit ourselves,
the more we shall be forgiven; and the less we know and submit ourselves,
the less we shall be forgiven; as appeareth by this example following:</p>
<p>Christ, when he was in this world, amongst the Jews and Pharisees,
there was a great Pharisee whose name was Simon: this Pharisee desired
Christ on a time to dine with him, thinking in himself that he was able
and worthy to give Christ a dinner.&nbsp; Christ refused not his dinner,
but came unto him.&nbsp; In time of their dinner it chanced there came
into the house a great and a common sinner named Mary Magdalene.&nbsp;
As soon as she perceived Christ, she cast herself down, and called unto
her remembrance what she was of herself, and how greatly she had offended
God; whereby she conceived in Christ great love, and so came near unto
him, and washed his feet with bitter tears, and shed upon his head precious
ointment, thinking that by him she should be delivered from her sins.&nbsp;
This great and proud Pharisee, seeing that Christ did accept her oblation
in the best part, had great indignation against this woman, and said
to himself, &ldquo;If this man Christ were a holy prophet, as he is
taken for, he would not suffer this sinner to come so nigh him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Christ, understanding the naughty mind of this Pharisee, said unto him,
&ldquo;Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Say
what you please,&rdquo; quod the Pharisee.&nbsp; Then said Christ, &ldquo;I
pray thee, tell me this: If there be a man to whom is owing twenty pound
by one, and forty by another, this man to whom this money is owing,
perceiving these two men be not able to pay him, he forgiveth them both:
which of these two debtors ought to love this man most?&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Pharisee said, &ldquo;That man ought to love him best, that had
most forgiven him.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Likewise,&rdquo; said Christ,
&ldquo;it is by this woman: she hath loved me most, therefore most is
forgiven her; she hath known her sins most, whereby she hath most loved
me.&nbsp; And thou hast least loved me, because thou hast least known
thy sins: therefore, because thou hast least known thine offences, thou
art least forgiven.&rdquo;&nbsp; So this proud Pharisee had an answer
to delay his pride.&nbsp; And think you not, but that there be amongst
us a great number of these proud Pharisees, which think themselves worthy
to bid Christ to dinner; which will perk, and presume to sit by Christ
in the church, and have a disdain of this poor woman Magdalene, their
poor neighbour, with a high, disdainous, and solemn countenance?&nbsp;
And being always desirous to climb highest in the church, reckoning
themselves more worthy to sit there than another, I fear me poor Magdalene
under the board, and in the belfry, hath more forgiven of Christ than
they have: for it is like that those Pharisees do less know themselves
and their offences, whereby they less love God, and so they be less
forgiven.</p>
<p>I would to God we would follow this example, and be like unto Magdalene.&nbsp;
I doubt not but we be all Magdalenes in falling into sin and in offending:
but we be not again Magdalenes in knowing ourselves, and in rising from
sin.&nbsp; If we be the true Magdalenes, we should be as willing to
forsake our sin and rise from sin, as we were willing to commit sin
and to continue in it; and we then should know ourselves best, and make
more perfect answer than ever we did unto this question, &ldquo;Who
art thou?&rdquo; to the which we might answer, that we be true christian
men and women: and then, I say, you should understand, and know how
you ought to play at this card, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill,&rdquo; without
any interruption of your deadly enemies the Turks; and so triumph at
the last, by winning everlasting life in glory.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<h3>ANOTHER SERMON OF M. LATIMER, CONCERNING THE SAME MATTER.</h3>
<p>Now you have heard what is meant by this first card, and how you
ought to play with it, I purpose again to deal unto you another card,
almost of the same suit; for they be of so nigh affinity, that one cannot
be well played without the other.&nbsp; The first card declared, that
you should not kill, which might be done divers ways; as being angry
with your neighbour, in mind, in countenance, in word, or deed: it declared
also, how you should subdue the passions of ire, and so clear evermore
yourselves from them.&nbsp; And whereas this first card doth kill in
you these stubborn Turks of ire; this second card will not only they
should be mortified in you, but that you yourselves shall cause them
to be likewise mortified in your neighbour, if that your said neighbour
hath been through your occasion moved unto ire, either in countenance,
word, or deed.&nbsp; Now let us hear therefore the tenor of this card:
&ldquo;When thou makest thine oblation at mine altar, and there dost
remember that thy neighbour hath any thing against thee, lay down there
thy oblation, and go first and reconcile thy neighbour, and then come
and offer thy oblation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This card was spoken by Christ, as testifieth St. Matthew in his
fifth chapter, against all such as do presume to come unto the church
to make oblation unto God either by prayer, or any other deed of charity,
not having their neighbours reconciled.&nbsp; Reconciling is as much
to say as to restore thy neighbour unto charity, which by thy words
or deeds is moved against thee: then, if so be it that thou hast spoken
to or by thy neighbour, whereby he is moved to ire or wrath, thou must
lay down thy oblation.&nbsp; Oblations be prayers, alms-deeds, or any
work of charity: these be all called oblations to God.&nbsp; Lay down
therefore thine oblation; begin to do none of these foresaid works before
thou goest unto thy neighbour, and confess thy fault unto him; declaring
thy mind, that if thou hast offended him, thou art glad and willing
to make him amends, as far forth as thy words and substance will extend,
requiring him not to take it at the worst: thou art sorry in thy mind,
that thou shouldest be occasion of his offending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What manner of card is this?&rdquo; will some say: &ldquo;Why,
what have I to do with my neighbour&rsquo;s or brother&rsquo;s malice?&rdquo;&nbsp;
As Cain said, &ldquo;Have I the keeping of my brother? or shall I answer
for him and for his faults?&nbsp; This were no reason&mdash;As for myself,
I thank God I owe no man malice nor displeasure: if others owe me any,
at their own peril be it.&nbsp; Let every man answer for himself!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nay, sir, not so, as you may understand by this card; for it saith,
&ldquo;If thy neighbour hath anything, any malice against thee, through
thine occasion, lay even down (saith Christ) thine oblation: pray not
to me; do no good deeds for me; but go first unto thy neighbour, and
bring him again unto my flock, which hath forsaken the same through
thy naughty words, mocks, scorns, or disdainous countenance, and so
forth; and then come and offer thine oblation; then do thy devotion;
then do thy alms-deeds; then pray, if thou wilt have me hear thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O good Lord! this is a hard reckoning, that I must go and
seek him out that is offended with me, before I pray or do any good
deed.&nbsp; I cannot go unto him.&nbsp; Peradventure he is a hundred
miles from me, beyond the seas; or else I cannot tell where: if he were
here nigh, I would with all my heart go unto him.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
is a lawful excuse before God on this fashion, that thou wouldest in
thy heart be glad to reconcile thy neighbour, if he were present; and
that thou thinkest in thy heart, whensoever thou shalt meet with him,
to go unto him, and require him charitably to forgive thee; and so never
intend to come from him, until the time that you both depart one from
the other true brethren in Christ.</p>
<p>Yet, peradventure, there be some in the world that be so devilish,
and so hard-hearted, that they will not apply in any condition unto
charity.&nbsp; For all that, do what lieth in thee, by all charitable
means, to bring him to unity.&nbsp; If he will in no wise apply thereunto,
thou mayest be sorrowful in thy heart, that by thine occasion that man
or woman continueth in such a damnable state.&nbsp; This notwithstanding,
if thou do the best that lieth in thee to reconcile him, according to
some doctors&rsquo; mind, thou art discharged towards God.&nbsp; Nevertheless
St. Augustine doubteth in this case, whether thy oblations, prayers,
or good deeds, shall avail thee before God, or no, until thy neighbour
come again to good state, whom thou hast brought out of the way.&nbsp;
Doth this noble doctor doubt therein?&nbsp; What aileth us to be so
bold, and count it but a small fault, or none, to bring our neighbour
out of patience for every trifle that standeth not with our mind?&nbsp;
You may see what a grievous thing this is, to bring another man out
of patience, that peradventure you cannot bring in again with all the
goods that you have: for surely, after the opinion of great wise men,
friendship once broken will be never well made whole again.&nbsp; Wherefore
you shall hear what Christ saith unto such persons.&nbsp; Saith Christ,
&ldquo;I came down into this world, and so took on me bitter passion
for man&rsquo;s sake, by the merits whereof I intended to make unity
and peace in mankind, to make man brother unto me, and so to expel the
dominion of Satan, the devil, which worketh nothing else but dissension:
and yet now there be a great number of you, that have professed my name,
and say you be christian men, which do rebel against my purpose and
mind.&nbsp; I go about to make my fold: you go about to break the same,
and kill my flock.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;How darest thou,&rdquo; saith
Christ, &ldquo;presume to come unto my altar, unto my church, or into
my presence, to make oblation unto me, that takest on thee to spoil
my lambs?&nbsp; I go about like a good shepherd to gather them together;
and thou dost the contrary, evermore ready to divide and lose them.&nbsp;
Who made thee so bold to meddle with my silly beasts, which I bought
so dearly with my precious blood?&nbsp; I warn thee out of my sight,
come not in my presence: I refuse thee and all thy works, except thou
go and bring home again my lambs which thou hast lost.&nbsp; Wherefore,
if thou thyself intend to be one of mine, lay even down by and by thine
oblation, and come no further toward mine altar; but go and seek them
without any questions, as it becometh a true and faithful servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A true and faithful servant, whensoever his master commandeth him
to do any thing, he maketh no stops nor questions, but goeth forth with
a good mind: and it is not unlike he, continuing in such a good mind
and will, shall well overcome all dangers and stops, whatsoever betide
him in his journey, and bring to pass effectually his master&rsquo;s
will and pleasure?&nbsp; On the contrary, a slothful servant, when his
master commandeth him to do any thing, by and by he will ask questions,
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;When?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Which way?&rdquo;
and so forth; and so be putteth every thing in doubt, that although
both his errand and way be never so plain, yet by his untoward and slothful
behaviour his master&rsquo;s commandment is either undone quite, or
else so done that it shall stand to no good purpose.&nbsp; Go now forth
with the good servant, and ask no such questions, and put no doubts.&nbsp;
Be not ashamed to do thy Master&rsquo;s and Lord&rsquo;s will and commandment.&nbsp;
Go, as I said, unto thy neighbour that is offended by thee, and reconcile
him (as is afore said) whom thou hast lost by thy unkind words, by thy
scorns, mocks, and other disdainous words and behaviours; and be not
nice to ask of him the cause why he is displeased with thee: require
of him charitably to remit; and cease not till you both depart, one
from the other, true brethren in Christ.</p>
<p>Do not, like the slothful servant, thy master&rsquo;s message with
cautels and doubts: come not to thy neighbour whom thou hast offended,
and give him a pennyworth of ale, or a banquet, and so make him a fair
countenance, thinking that by thy drink or dinner he will shew thee
like countenance.&nbsp; I grant you may both laugh and make good cheer,
and yet there may remain a bag of rusty malice, twenty years old, in
thy neighbour&rsquo;s bosom.&nbsp; When he departeth from thee with
a good countenance, thou thinkest all is well then.&nbsp; But now, I
tell thee, it is worse than it was, for by such cloaked charity, where
thou dost offend before Christ but once, thou hast offended twice herein:
for now thou goest about to give Christ a mock, if be would take it
of thee.&nbsp; Thou thinkest to blind thy master Christ&rsquo;s commandment.&nbsp;
Beware, do not so, for at length he will overmatch thee, and take thee
tardy whatsoever thou be; and so, as I said, it should be better for
thee not to do his message on this fashion, for it will stand thee in
no purpose.&nbsp; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; some will say, &ldquo;I am sure
he loveth me well enough: he speaketh fair to my face.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Yet for all that thou mayest be deceived.&nbsp; It proveth not true
love in a man, to speak fair.&nbsp; If he love thee with his mind and
heart, he loveth thee with his eyes, with his tongue, with his feet,
with his hands and his body; for all these parts of a man&rsquo;s body
be obedient to the will and mind.&nbsp; He loveth thee with his eves,
that looketh cheerfully on thee, when thou meetest with him, and is
glad to see thee prosper and do well.&nbsp; He loveth thee with his
tongue, that speaketh well by thee behind thy back, or giveth thee good
counsel.&nbsp; He loveth thee with his feet, that is willing to go to
help thee out of trouble and business.&nbsp; He loveth thee with his
hands, that will help thee in time of necessity, by giving some alms-deeds,
or with any other occupation of the hand.&nbsp; He loveth thee with
his body, that will labour with his body, or put his body in danger
to do good for thee, or to deliver thee from adversity: and so forth,
with the other members of his body.&nbsp; And if thy neighbour will
do according to these sayings, then thou mayest think that he loveth
thee well; and thou, in like wise, oughtest to declare and open thy
love unto thy neighbour in like fashion, or else you be bound one to
reconcile the other, till this perfect love be engendered amongst you.</p>
<p>It may fortune thou wilt say, &ldquo;I am content to do the best
for my neighbour that I can, saving myself harmless.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
promise thee, Christ will not hear this excuse; for he himself suffered
harm for our sakes, and for our salvation was put to extreme death.&nbsp;
I wis, if it had pleased him, he might have saved us and never felt
pain; but in suffering pains and death he did give us example, and teach
us how we should do one for another, as he did for us all; for, as he
saith himself, &ldquo;he that will be mine, let him deny himself, and
follow me, in bearing my cross and suffering my pains.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Wherefore we must needs suffer pain with Christ to do our neighbour
good, as well with the body and all his members, as with heart and mind.</p>
<p>Now I trust you wot what your card meaneth: let us see how that we
can play with the same.&nbsp; Whensoever it shall happen you to go and
make your oblation unto God, ask of yourselves this question, &ldquo;Who
art thou?&rdquo;&nbsp; The answer, as you know, is, &ldquo;I am a christian
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then you must again ask unto yourself, What Christ
requireth of a christian man?&nbsp; By and by cast down your trump,
your heart, and look first of one card, then of another.&nbsp; The first
card telleth thee, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not be angry, thou
shalt not be out of patience.&nbsp; This done, thou shalt look if there
be any more cards to take up; and if thou look well, thou shalt see
another card of the same suit, wherein thou shalt know that thou art
bound to reconcile thy neighbour.&nbsp; Then cast thy trump upon them
both, and gather them all three together, and do according to the virtue
of thy cards; and surely thou shalt not lose.&nbsp; Thou shalt first
kill the great Turks, and discomfort and thrust them down.&nbsp; Thou
shalt again fetch home Christ&rsquo;s sheep that thou hast lost; whereby
thou mayest go both patiently and with a quiet mind unto the church,
and make thy oblation unto God; and then, without doubt, he will hear
thee.</p>
<p>But yet Christ will not accept our oblation (although we be in patience,
and have reconciled our neighbour), if that our oblation be made of
another man&rsquo;s substance; but it must be our own.&nbsp; See therefore
that thou hast gotten thy goods according to the laws of God and of
thy prince.&nbsp; For if thou gettest thy goods by polling and extortion,
or by any other unlawful ways, then, if thou offer a thousand pound
of it, it will stand thee in no good effect; for it is not thine.&nbsp;
In this point a great number of executors do offend; for when they be
made rich by other men&rsquo;s goods, then they will take upon them
to build churches, to give ornaments to God and his altar, to gild saints,
and to do many good works therewith; but it shall be all in their own
name, and for their own glory.&nbsp; Wherefore, saith Christ, they have
in this world their reward; and so their oblations be not their own,
nor be they acceptable before God.</p>
<p>Another way God will refuse thy voluntary oblation, as thus: if so
be it that thou hast gotten never so truly thy goods, according both
to the laws of God and man, and hast with the same goods not relieved
thy poor neighbour, when thou hast seen him hungry, thirsty, and naked,
he will not take thy oblation when thou shalt offer the same, because
he will say unto thee, &ldquo;When I was hungry, thou gavest me no meat;
when I was thirsty, thou gavest me no drink; and when I was naked, thou
didst not clothe me.&nbsp; Wherefore I will not take thy oblation, because
it is none of thine.&nbsp; I left it thee to relieve thy poor neighbours,
and thou hast not therein done according unto this my commandment, <i>Misericordiam
volo, et non sacrificium</i>; I had rather have mercy done, than sacrifice
or oblation.&nbsp; Wherefore until thou dost the one more than the other,
I will not accept thine oblation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evermore bestow the greatest part of thy goods in works of mercy,
and the less part in voluntary works.&nbsp; Voluntary works be called
all manner of offering in the church, except your four offering-days,
and your tithes: setting up candles, gilding and painting, building
of churches, giving of ornaments, going on pilgrimages, making of highways,
and such other, be called voluntary works; which works be of themselves
marvellous good, and convenient to be done.&nbsp; Necessary works, and
works of mercy, are called the commandments, the four offering-days,
your tithes, and such other that belong to the commandments; and works
of mercy consist in relieving and visiting thy poor neighbours.&nbsp;
Now then, if men be so foolish of themselves, that they will bestow
the most part of their goods in voluntary works, which they be not bound
to keep, but willingly and by their devotion; and leave the necessary
works undone, which they are bound to do; they and all their voluntary
works are like to go unto everlasting damnation.&nbsp; And I promise
you, if you build a hundred churches, give as much as you can make to
gilding of saints, and honouring of the church; and if thou go as many
pilgrimages as thy body can well suffer, and offer as great candles
as oaks; if thou leave the works of mercy and the commandments undone,
these works shall nothing avail thee.&nbsp; No doubt the voluntary works
be good and ought to be done; but yet they must be so done, that by
their occasion the necessary works and the works of mercy be not decayed
and forgotten.&nbsp; If you will build a glorious church unto God, see
first yourself to be in charity with your neighbours, and suffer not
them to be offended by your works.&nbsp; Then, when ye come into your
parish-church; you bring with you the holy temple of God; as St. Paul
saith, &ldquo;You yourselves be the very holy temples of God:&rdquo;
and Christ saith by his prophet, &ldquo;In you will I rest, and intend
to make my mansion and abiding-place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again, if you list
to gild and paint Christ in your churches, and honour him in vestments,
see that before your eyes the poor people die not for lack of meat,
drink, and clothing.&nbsp; Then do you deck the very true temple of
God, and honour him in rich vestures that will never be worn, and so
forth use yourselves according unto the commandments: and then, finally,
set up your candles, and they will report what a glorious light remaineth
in your hearts; for it is not fitting to see a dead man light candles.&nbsp;
Then, I say, go your pilgrimages, build your material churches, do all
your voluntary works; and they will then represent you unto God, and
testify with you, that you have provided him a glorious place in your
hearts.&nbsp; But beware, I say again, that you do not run so far in
your voluntary works, that ye do quite forget your necessary works of
mercy, which you are bound to keep: you must have ever a good respect
unto the best and worthiest works toward God to be done first and with
more efficacy, and the other to be done secondarily.&nbsp; Thus if you
do, with the other that I have spoken of before, ye may come according
to the tenor of your cards, and offer your oblations and prayers to
our Lord Jesus Christ, who will both hear and accept them to your everlasting
joy and glory: to the which he bring us, and all those whom he suffered
death for.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<h2>A SERMON MADE BY M. HUGH LATIMER, AT THE TIME OF THE INSURRECTION
IN THE NORTH, WHICH WAS IN THE TWENTY-SEVENTH YEAR OF THE REIGN OF KING
HENRY THE EIGHTH, ANN. DOM. 1535.&nbsp; UPON THE EPISTLE READ IN THE
CHURCH THE TWENTY-FIRST SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY SUNDAY, TAKEN OUT OF THE
SIXTH CHAPTER OF THE EPISTLE OF ST.&nbsp; PAUL TO THE EPHESIANS.</h2>
<blockquote><p><i>Put on all the armour of God, that ye may stand</i>,
&amp;c.&nbsp; [Ephes. vi. 10, et seq.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Saint Paul, the holy apostle, writeth this epistle unto the Ephesians,
that is, to the people of the city of Ephesus.&nbsp; He writeth generally,
to them all; and in the former chapters he teacheth them severally how
they should behave themselves, in every estate, one to another; how
they should obey their rulers; how wives should behave themselves towards
their husbands; children towards their parents; and servants towards
their masters; and husbands, parents and masters should behave them,
and love their wives, children, and servants; and generally each to
love other.</p>
<p>Now cometh he forth and comforteth them, and teacheth them to be
bold, and to play the men, and fight manfully.&nbsp; For they must fight
with valiant warriors, as appeareth afterward in the text.&nbsp; And
against they come to fight he comforteth them, saying, &ldquo;My brethren.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He calleth them brethren; for though he taught them before to be subject
to kings and rulers, and to be obedient to their superiors, yet he teacheth
them that in Christ we be all brethren, according to the saying in this
same chapter, &ldquo;God is no accepter of persons.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;My
brethren,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;be ye comforted, be ye strong;&rdquo;
not trusting to yourselves; no, but be bold, and comforted &ldquo;by
our Lord, and by the power of his virtue:&rdquo; not by your own virtue,
for it is not of power to resist such assaults as he speaketh of hereafter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Put on, or apparel you with, the armour of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Armour is an apparel to clothe a man, and maketh him seemly and comely;
setteth forth his body, and maketh him strong and bold in battle.&nbsp;
And therefore Saint Paul exhorteth generally his brethren to be armed;
and as the assaults be strong, and not small, so he giveth strong armour,
and not small: &ldquo;Put on,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;the armour of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; He speaketh generally of armour, but afterwards he
speaketh particularly of the parts of armour, where he saith, be armed
complete, whole; be armed on every part with the armour of God; not
borrowed, nor patched, but all godly.&nbsp; And as armour setteth forth
a man&rsquo;s body, so this godly armour maketh us seemly in the sight
of God, and acceptable in his wars.</p>
<p>Be ye therefore &ldquo;armed at all points with the armour of God,
that ye may stand strongly against the assaults of the devil.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That ye may stand,&rdquo; saith he.&nbsp; Ye must stand in this
battle, and not sit, nor lie along; for he that lieth is trodden under
foot of his enemy.&nbsp; We may not sit, that is, not rest in sin, or
lie along in sluggishness of sin; but continually fight against our
enemy, and under our great Captain and Sovereign Lord Jesus Christ,
and in his quarrel, armed with the armour of God, that we may be strong.&nbsp;
We cannot be strong unless we be armed of God.&nbsp; We have no power
of ourselves to stand against the assaults of the devil.&nbsp; There
St. Paul teacheth what our battle is, and wherefore we must be thus
armed.</p>
<p>For, saith he, &ldquo;we have not wrestling or strife against flesh
and blood:&rdquo; which may be understood, against certain sins, which
come of the flesh only; but let us take it as it standeth, &ldquo;against
flesh and blood,&rdquo; that is, against any corporal man, which is
but a weak thing in comparison, and with one stroke destroyed or slain:
but we have to do with strong, mighty princes and potentates; that mighty
prince, that great conqueror of this world, the devil, yea a conqueror:
for though our Saviour Jesus Christ conquered him and all his, by suffering
his blessed passion, yet is he a great conqueror in this world, and
reigneth over a great multitude of his own, and maketh continual conflicts
and assaults against the rest, to subdue them also under his power;
which, if they be armed after St. Paul&rsquo;s teaching, shall stand
strongly against his assaults.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our battle,&rdquo; saith
St. Paul, &ldquo;is against princes, potestates,&rdquo; that is, against
devils: for, after the common opinion, there fell from heaven of every
order of angels, as of potentates.&nbsp; He saith also, &ldquo;against
worldly rulers of these darknesses:&rdquo; for, as doctors do write,
the spirits that fell with Lucifer have their being in <i>a&euml;re
caliginoso</i>, the air, in darkness, and the rulers of this world,
by God&rsquo;s sufferance, to hurt, vex and assault them that live upon
the earth.&nbsp; For their nature is, as they be damned, to desire to
draw all mankind unto like damnation; such is their malice.&nbsp; And
though they hang in the air, or fall in a garden or other pleasant place,
yet have they continually their pain upon their backs.&nbsp; Against
these we wrestle, and &ldquo;against spiritual wickedness in <i>coelestibus</i>,&rdquo;
that is, in the air; or we fight against spiritual wickedness in heavenly
things.</p>
<p>Think you not that this our enemy, this prince with all his potentates,
hath great and sore assaults to lay against our armour?&nbsp; Yea, he
is a crafty warrior, and also of great power in this world; he hath
great ordnance and artillery; he hath great pieces of ordnance, as mighty
kings and emperors, to shoot against God&rsquo;s people, to persecute
or kill them; Nero, the great tyrant, who slew Paul, and divers other.&nbsp;
Yea, what great pieces hath he had of bishops of Rome, which have destroyed
whole cities and countries, and have slain and burnt many!&nbsp; What
great guns were those!</p>
<p>Yea, he hath also less ordnance evil enough, (they may be called
<i>serpentines</i>;) some bishops in divers countries, and here in England,
which he hath shot at some good christian men, that they have been blown
to ashes.&nbsp; So can this great captain, the devil, shoot his ordnance.&nbsp;
He hath yet less ordnance, for he hath of all sorts to shoot at good
christian men; he hath hand-guns and bows, which do much hurt, but not
so much as the great ordnance.&nbsp; These be accusers, promoters, and
slanderers; they be evil ordnance, shrewd hand-guns, and bows; they
put a man to great displeasure; oftentimes death cometh upon that shot.&nbsp;
For these things, saith the text, &ldquo;take the armour of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Against the great captains, the devils, and against their artillery,
their ministers, there can nothing defend us but the armour of God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take therefore this armour,&rdquo; saith the text, &ldquo;that
ye may resist in the evil day, and in all things stand perfectly, or
be perfectly strong.&rdquo;&nbsp; This evil day is not so called here,
because any day or time is evil; for God made every day good, and all
days be good: but St. Paul calleth it the &ldquo;evil day,&rdquo; because
of the misfortune that chanceth or cometh in that day.&nbsp; As we have
a common saying, &ldquo;I have had an evil day, and an evil night,&rdquo;
because of the heaviness or evil that hath happened; so saith Paul,
&ldquo;that ye may resist in the evil day:&rdquo; that is, when your
great adversary hath compassed you round about with his potestates and
rulers, and with his artillery, so that you be almost overcome, then,
if you have the armour of God, you shall be strong, and need not to
fear his assaults.</p>
<p>St. Paul hath spoken of this armour of God generally, and now declareth
the parts and pieces of armour; and teacheth them how to apparel every
part of the body with this armour.&nbsp; He beginneth yet again, saying,
&ldquo;Be strong, having your reins, or your loins girded about.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Some men of war use to have about their loins an apron or girdle of
mail, gird fast for the safeguard of the nether part of their body.&nbsp;
So St. Paul would we should gird our loins, which betokeneth lechery
or other sinfulness, with a girdle, which is to be taken for a restraint
or continence from such vices.&nbsp; In &ldquo;truth,&rdquo; or &ldquo;truly
gird:&rdquo; it may not be feigned, or falsely girt, but in verity and
truth.&nbsp; There be many bachelors, as yet men unmarried, which seem
to be girt with the girdle of continence, and yet it is not in truth,
it is but feignedly.&nbsp; And some religious persons make a profession
of continence or chastity, and yet not in truth, their hearts be not
truly chaste.&nbsp; Such feigned girding of the loins cannot make a
man strong to resist the assaults of the great captain or enemy in the
evil day.&nbsp; Yet some get them girdles with great knots, as though
they would be surely girt, and as though they would break the devil&rsquo;s
head with their knotted girdles.&nbsp; Nay, he will not be so overcome:
it is no knot of an hempton girdle that he feareth; that is no piece
of harness of the armour of God, which may resist the assault in the
evil day; it is but feigned gear; it must be in the heart, &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be ye apparelled or clothed,&rdquo; saith Paul, &ldquo;with
the habergeon or coat-armour of justice, that is, righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Let your body be clothed in the armour of righteousness: ye may do no
wrong to any man, but live in righteousness; not clothed with any false
quarrel or privy grudge.&nbsp; Ye must live rightly in God&rsquo;s law,
following his commandments and doctrine, clothed righteously in his
armour, and not in any feigned armour, as in a friar&rsquo;s coat or
cowl.&nbsp; For the assaults of the devil be crafty to make us put our
trust in such armour, he will feign himself to fly; but then we be most
in jeopardy: for he can give us an after-clap when we least ween; that
is, suddenly return unawares to us, and then he giveth us an after-clap
that overthroweth us: this armour deceiveth us.</p>
<p>In like manner these men in the North country, they make pretence
as though they were armed in God&rsquo;s armour, gird in truth, and
clothed in righteousness.&nbsp; I hear say they wear the cross and the
wounds before and behind, and they pretend much truth to the king&rsquo;s
grace and to the commonwealth, when they intend nothing less; and deceive
the poor ignorant people, and bring them to fight against both the king,
the church, and the commonwealth.</p>
<p>They arm them with the sign of the cross and of the wounds, and go
clean contrary to him that bare the cross, and suffered those wounds.&nbsp;
They rise with the king, and fight against the king in his ministers
and officers; they rise with the church, and fight against the church,
which is the congregation of faithful men; they rise for the commonwealth,
and fight against it, and go about to make the commons each to kill
other, and to destroy the commonwealth.&nbsp; Lo, what false pretence
can the devil send amongst us?&nbsp; It is one of his most crafty and
subtle assaults, to send his warriors forth under the badge of God,
as though they were armed in righteousness and justice.</p>
<p>But if we will resist strongly indeed, we must he clothed or armed
with the habergeon of very justice or righteousness; in true obedience
to our prince, and faithful love to our neighbours; and take no false
quarrels in hand, nor any feigned armour; but in justice, &ldquo;having
your feet shod for [the] preparation of the gospel of peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lo, what manner of battle this warrior St. Paul teacheth us, &ldquo;to
be shod on our feet,&rdquo; that we may go readily and prepare way for
the gospel; yea, the gospel of peace, not of rebellion, not of insurrection:
no, it teacheth obedience, humility, and quietness; it maketh peace
in the conscience, and teacheth true faith in Jesus Christ, and to walk
in God&rsquo;s laws armed with God&rsquo;s armour, as Paul teacheth
here.&nbsp; Yea, if bishops in England had been &ldquo;shod for the
preparation of this gospel,&rdquo; and had endeavoured themselves to
teach and set [it] forth, as our most noble prince hath devised; and
if certain gentlemen, being justices, had executed his grace&rsquo;s
commandment, in setting forth this gospel of peace, this disturbance
among the people had not happened.</p>
<p>But ye say, it is new learning.&nbsp; Now I tell you it is the old
learning.&nbsp; Yea, ye say, it is old heresy new scoured.&nbsp; Nay,
I tell you it is old truth, long rusted with your canker, and now new
made bright and scoured.&nbsp; What a rusty truth is this, <i>Quodcumque
ligaveris</i>, &ldquo;Whatsoever thou bindest,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp;
This is a truth spoken to the apostles, and all true preachers their
successors, that with the law of God they should bind and condemn all
that sinned; and whosoever did repent, they should declare him loosed
and forgiven, by believing in the blood of Christ.&nbsp; But how hath
this truth over-rusted with the pope&rsquo;s rust?&nbsp; For he, by
this text, &ldquo;Whatsoever thou bindeth,&rdquo; hath taken upon him
to make what laws him listed, clean contrary unto God&rsquo;s word,
which willeth that every man should obey the prince&rsquo;s law: and
by this text, &ldquo;Whatsoever thou loosest,&rdquo; he hath made all
people believe that, for money, he might forgive what and whom he lusted;
so that if any man had robbed his master, or taken anything wrongfully,
the pope would loose him, by this pardon or that pardon, given to these
friars or those friars, put in this box or that box.&nbsp; And, as it
were, by these means a dividend of the spoil was made, so that it was
not restored, nor the person rightly discharged; and yet most part of
the spoil came to the hands of him and his ministers.&nbsp; What is
this but a new learning; a new canker to rust and corrupt the old truth?&nbsp;
Ye call your learning old: it may indeed be called old, for it cometh
of that serpent which did pervert God&rsquo;s commandment and beguiled
Eve; so it is an old custom to pervert God&rsquo;s word, and to rust
it, and corrupt it.</p>
<p>We be a great many that profess to be true ministers of the gospel;
but at the trial I think it will come to pass as it did with Gideon,
a duke, which God raised up to deliver the children of Israel from the
Midianites, in whose hands they were fallen, because they had broken
God&rsquo;s commandment, and displeased God: yet at the length he had
compassion on them, and raised up Gideon to deliver them.&nbsp; When
they heard that they had a captain, or a duke, that should deliver them,
they assembled a great number, about thirty thousand: but when it came
to pass that they should fight, they departed all save five hundred.&nbsp;
So, I fear me, that at the trial we shall be found but a few ministers
of the true gospel of peace, and armed in the true armour of God.</p>
<p>It followeth, &ldquo;And in all things take the shield or buckler
of faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; The buckler is a thing wherewith a man most chiefly
defendeth himself: and that must be perfect faith in Jesus Christ, in
our Captain, and in his word.&nbsp; It must also be a true faith, it
is else no part of the armour of God: it may not be feigned, but a buckler,
which may stop or quench the violence of the flaming darts of the most
wicked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take also the helmet or head-piece of health,&rdquo; or true
health in Jesus Christ; for there is no health in any other name: not
the health of a grey friar&rsquo;s coat, or the health of this pardon
or that pardon; that were a false helmet, and should not defend the
violence of the wicked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Lo, St. Paul teacheth you battle; to take in your left hand the shield
of faith, to defend and bear off the darts of the devil, and in the
other hand a sword to strike with against the enemy: for a good man
of war may not stand against, and defend only, but also strike against
his enemy.&nbsp; So St. Paul giveth us here a sword, &ldquo;The word
of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; For this sword is it that beateth this great captain,
our enemy.&nbsp; Christ himself gave us ensample to fight with this
sword; for he answered the devil with the scripture, and said, &ldquo;It
is written.&rdquo;&nbsp; With this sword he drave away the devil: and
so let us break his head with this sword, the true word of God, and
not with any word of the bishop of Rome&rsquo;s making; not with his
old learning, nor his new learning, but with the pure word of God.</p>
<p>The time passeth: I will therefore make an end.&nbsp; Let us fight
manfully, and not cease; for no man is crowned or rewarded but in the
end.&nbsp; We must therefore fight continually, and with this sword;
and thus armed, and we shall receive the reward of victory.&nbsp; And
thus the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all your spirits.&nbsp;
Amen.</p>
<h2>THE SERMON THAT THE REVEREND FATHER IN CHRIST, M. HUGH LATIMER,
BISHOP OF WORCESTER, MADE TO THE CONVOCATION OF THE CLERGY, BEFORE THE
PARLIAMENT BEGAN, THE 9 DAY OF JUNE, THE 28 YEAR OF THE REIGN OF OUR
LATE KING HENRY THE 8.&nbsp; TRANSLATED OUT OF LATIN INTO ENGLISH, TO
THE INTENT THAT THINGS WELL SAID TO A FEW MAY BE UNDERSTOOD OF MANY,
AND DO GOOD TO ALL THEM THAT DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUTH.</h2>
<blockquote><p><i>Filii hujus seculi</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;Luc. xvi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brethren, ye be come together this day, as far as I perceive, to
hear of great and weighty matters.&nbsp; Ye be come together to entreat
of things that most appertain to the commonwealth.&nbsp; This being
thus, ye look, I am assured, to hear of me, which am commanded to make
as a preface this exhortation, (albeit I am unlearned and far unworthy,)
such things as shall be much meet for this your assembly.&nbsp; I therefore,
not only very desirous to obey the commandment of our Primate, but also
right greatly coveting to serve and satisfy all your expectation; lo,
briefly, and as plainly as I can, will speak of matters both worthy
to be heard in your congregation, and also of such as best shall become
mine office in this place.&nbsp; That I may do this the more commodiously,
I have taken that notable sentence in which our Lord was not afraid
to pronounce &ldquo;the children of this world to be much more prudent
and politic than the children of light in their generation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Neither will I be afraid, trusting that he will aid and guide me to
use this sentence, as a good ground and foundation of all such things,
as hereafter I shall speak of.</p>
<p>Now, I suppose that you see right well, being men of such learning,
for what purpose the Lord said this, and that ye have no need to be
holpen with any part of my labour in this thing.&nbsp; But yet, if ye
will pardon me, I will wade somewhat deeper in this matter, and as nigh
as I can, fetch it from the first original beginning.&nbsp; For undoubtedly,
ye may much marvel at this saying, if ye well ponder both what is said,
and who saith it.&nbsp; Define me first these three things: what prudence
is; what the world; what light; and who be the children of the world;
who of the light: see what they signify in scripture.&nbsp; I marvel
if by and by ye all agree, that the children of the world should be
wiser than the children of the light.&nbsp; To come somewhat nigher
the matter, thus the Lord beginneth:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was a certain rich man that had a steward, which
was accused unto him that he had dissipated and wasted his goods.&nbsp;
This rich man called his steward to him and said, What is this that
I hear of thee?&nbsp; Come, make me an account of thy stewardship; thou
mayest no longer bear this office.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brethren, because these words are so spoken in a parable, and are
so wrapped in wrinkles, that yet they seem to have a face and a similitude
of a thing done indeed, and like an history, I think it much profitable
to tarry somewhat in them.&nbsp; And though we may perchance find in
our hearts to believe all that is there spoken to be true; yet I doubt
whether we may abide it, that these words of Christ do pertain unto
us, and admonish us of our duty, which do and live after such sort,
as though Christ, when he spake any thing, had, as the time served him,
served his turn, and not regarded the time that came after him, neither
provided for us, or any matters of ours; as some of the philosophers
thought, which said, that God walked up and down in heaven, and thinketh
never a deal of our affairs.&nbsp; But, my good brethren, err not you
so; stick not you to such your imaginations.&nbsp; For if ye inwardly
behold these words, if ye diligently roll them in your minds, and after
explicate and open them, ye shall see our time much touched in these
mysteries.&nbsp; Ye shall perceive that God by this example shaketh
us by the noses and pulleth us by the ears.&nbsp; Ye shall perceive
very plain, that God setteth before our eyes in this similitude what
we ought most to flee, and what we ought soonest to follow.&nbsp; For
Luke saith, &ldquo;The Lord spake these words to his disciples.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Wherefore let it be out of all doubt that he spake them to us, which
even as we will be counted the successors and vicars of Christ&rsquo;s
disciples, so we be, if we be good dispensers and do our duty.&nbsp;
He said these things partly to us, which spake them partly of himself.&nbsp;
For he is that rich man, which not only had, but hath, and shall have
evermore, I say not one, but many stewards, even to the end of the world.</p>
<p>He is man, seeing that he is God and man.&nbsp; He is rich, not only
in mercy but in all kind of riches; for it is he that giveth to us all
things abundantly.&nbsp; It is he of whose hand we received both our
lives, and other things necessary for the conservation of the same.&nbsp;
What man hath any thing, I pray you, but he hath received it of his
plentifulness?&nbsp; To be short, it is he that &ldquo;openeth his hand,
and filleth all beasts with his blessing,&rdquo; and giveth unto us
in most ample wise his benediction.&nbsp; Neither his treasure can be
spent, how much soever he lash out; how much soever we take of him,
his treasure tarrieth still, ever taken, never spent.</p>
<p>He is also the good man of the house: the church is his household
which ought with all diligence to be fed with his word and his sacraments.&nbsp;
These be his goods most precious, the dispensation and administration
whereof he would bishops and curates should have.&nbsp; Which thing
St. Paul affirmeth, saying, &ldquo;Let men esteem us as the ministers
of Christ, and dispensers of God&rsquo;s mysteries.&rdquo;&nbsp; But,
I pray you, what is to be looked for in a dispenser?&nbsp; This surely,
&ldquo;That he be found faithful,&rdquo; and that he truly dispense,
and lay out the goods of the Lord; that he give meat in time; give it,
I say, and not sell it; meat, I say, and not poison.&nbsp; For the one
doth intoxicate and slay the eater, the other feedeth and nourisheth
him.&nbsp; Finally, let him not slack and defer the doing of his office,
but let him do his duty when time is, and need requireth it.&nbsp; This
is also to be looked for, that he be one whom God hath called and put
in office, and not one that cometh uncalled, unsent for; not one that
of himself presumeth to take honour upon him.&nbsp; And surely, if all
this that I say be required in a good minister, it is much lighter to
require them all in every one, than to find one any where that hath
them all.&nbsp; Who is a true and faithful steward?&nbsp; He is true,
he is faithful, that cometh no new money, but taketh it ready coined
of the good man of the house; and neither changeth it, nor clippeth
it, after it is taken to him to spend, but spendeth even the self-same
that he had of his Lord, and spendeth it as his Lord&rsquo;s commandment
is; neither to his own vantage uttering it, nor as the lewd servant
did, hiding it in the ground.&nbsp; Brethren, if a faithful steward
ought to do as I have said, I pray you, ponder and examine this well,
whether our bishops and abbots, prelates and curates, have been hitherto
faithful stewards or no?&nbsp; Ponder, whether yet many of them be as
they should be or no?&nbsp; Go ye to, tell me now as your conscience
leadeth you (I will let pass to speak of many other), was there not
some, that despising the money of the Lord, as copper and not current,
either coined new themselves, or else uttered abroad newly coined of
other; sometime either adulterating the word of God or else mingling
it (as taverners do, which brew and utter the evil and good both in
one pot), sometime in the stead of God&rsquo;s word blowing out the
dreams of men? while they thus preached to the people the redemption
that cometh by Christ&rsquo;s death to serve only them that died before
his coming, that were in the time of the old testament; and that now
since redemption and forgiveness of sins purchased by money, and devised
by men is of efficacy, and not redemption purchased by Christ (they
have a wonderful pretty example to persuade this thing, of a certain
married woman, which, when her husband was in purgatory, in that fiery
furnace that hath burned away so many of our pence, paid her husband&rsquo;s
ransom, and so of duty claimed him to be set at liberty): while they
thus preached to the people, that dead images (which at the first, as
I think, were set up, only to represent things absent) not only ought
to be covered with gold, but also ought of all faithful and christian
people (yea, in this scarceness and penury of all things), to be clad
with silk garments, and those also laden with precious gems and jewels;
and that beside all this, they are to be lighted with wax candles, both
within the church and without the church, yea, and at noon days; as
who should say, here no cost can be too great; whereas in the mean time
we see Christ&rsquo;s faithful and lively images, bought with no less
price than with his most precious blood (alas, alas!) to be an hungred,
a-thirst, a-cold, and to lie in darkness, wrapped in all wretchedness,
yea, to lie there till death take away their miseries: while they preached
these will-works, that come but of our own devotion, although they be
not so necessary as the works of mercy, and the precepts of God, yet
they said, and in the pulpit, that will-works were more principal, more
excellent, and (plainly to utter what they mean) more acceptable to
God than works of mercy; as though now man&rsquo;s inventions and fancies
could please God better than God&rsquo;s precepts, or strange things
better than his own: while they thus preached that more fruit, more
devotion cometh of the beholding of an image, though it be but a Pater-noster
while, than is gotten by reading and contemplation in scripture, though
ye read and contemplate therein seven years&rsquo; space: finally, while
they preached thus, souls tormented in purgatory to have most need of
our help, and that they can have no aid, but of us in this world: of
the which two, if the one be not false, yet at the least it is ambiguous,
uncertain, doubtful, and therefore rashly and arrogantly with such boldness
affirmed in the audience of the people; the other, by all men&rsquo;s
opinions, is manifestly false: I let pass to speak of much other such
like counterfeit doctrine, which hath been blasted and blown out by
some for the space of three hours together.&nbsp; Be these the Christian
and divine mysteries, and not rather the dreams of men?&nbsp; Be these
the faithful dispensers of God&rsquo;s mysteries, and not rather false
dissipators of them? whom God never put in office, but rather the devil
set them over a miserable family, over an house miserably ordered and
entreated.&nbsp; Happy were the people if such preached seldom.</p>
<p>And yet it is a wonder to see these, in their generation, to be much
more prudent and politic than the faithful ministers are in their generation;
while they go about more prudently to stablish men&rsquo;s dreams, than
these do to hold up God&rsquo;s commandments.</p>
<p>Thus it cometh to pass that works lucrative, will-works, men&rsquo;s
fancies reign; but christian works, necessary works, fruitful works,
be trodden under the foot.&nbsp; Thus the evil is much better set out
by evil men, than the good by good men; because the evil be more wise
than be the good in their generation.&nbsp; These be the false stewards,
whom all good and faithful men every day accuse unto the rich master
of the household, not without great heaviness, that they waste his goods;
whom he also one day will call to him, and say to them as he did to
his steward, when he said, &ldquo;What is this that I hear of thee?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here God partly wondereth at our ingratitude and perfidy, partly chideth
us for them; and being both full of wonder and ready to chide, asketh
us, &ldquo;What is this that I hear of you?&rdquo;&nbsp; As though he
should say unto us, &ldquo;All good men in all places complain of you,
accuse your avarice, your exactions, your tyranny.&nbsp; They have required
in you a long season, and yet require, diligence and sincerity.&nbsp;
I commanded you, that with all industry and labour ye should feed my
sheep: ye earnestly feed yourselves from day to day, wallowing in delights
and idleness.&nbsp; I commanded you to teach my commandments, and not
your fancies; and that ye should seek my glory and my vantage: you teach
your own traditions, and seek your own glory and profit.&nbsp; You preach
very seldom; and when ye do preach, do nothing but cumber them that
preach truly, as much as lieth in you: that it were much better such
were not to preach at all, than so perniciously to preach.&nbsp; Oh,
what hear I of you?&nbsp; You, that ought to be my preachers, what other
thing do you, than apply all your study hither, to bring all my preachers
to envy, shame, contempt?&nbsp; Yea, more than this, ye pull them into
perils, into prisons, and, as much as in you lieth, to cruel deaths.&nbsp;
To be short, I would that christian people should hear my doctrine,
and at their convenient leisure read it also, as many as would: your
care is not that all men may hear it, but all your care is, that no
lay man do read it: surely, being afraid lest they by the reading should
understand it, and understanding, learn to rebuke our slothfulness.&nbsp;
This is your generation, this is your dispensation, this is your wisdom.&nbsp;
In this generation, in this dispensation, you be most politic, most
witty.&nbsp; These be the things that I hear of your demeanour.&nbsp;
I wished to hear better report of you.&nbsp; Have ye thus deceived me?
or have ye rather deceived yourselves?&nbsp; Where I had but one house,
that is to say, the church, and this so dearly beloved of me, that for
the love of her I put myself forth to be slain, and to shed my blood;
this church at my departure I committed unto your charge, to be fed,
to be nourished, and to be made much of.&nbsp; My pleasure was ye should
occupy my place; my desire was ye should have borne like love to this
church, like fatherly affection, as I did: I made you my vicars, yea,
in matters of most importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For thus I taught openly: &lsquo;He that should hear you,
should hear me; he that should despise you, should despise me.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I gave you also keys, not earthly keys, but heavenly.&nbsp; I left my
goods that I have evermore most highly esteemed, that is, my word and
sacraments, to be dispensed of you.&nbsp; These benefits I gave you,
and do you give me these thanks?&nbsp; Can you find in your hearts thus
to abuse my goodness, my benignity, my gentleness?&nbsp; Have you thus
deceived me?&nbsp; No, no, ye have not deceived me, but yourselves.&nbsp;
My gifts and benefits towards you shall be to your greater damnation.&nbsp;
Because you have contemned the lenity and clemency of the master of
the house, ye have right well deserved to abide the rigour and severity
of the judge.&nbsp; Come forth then, let us see an account of your stewardship.&nbsp;
An horrible and fearful sentence: Ye may have no longer my goods in
your hands.&nbsp; A voice to weep at, and to make men tremble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You see, brethren, you see, what evil the evil stewards must come
to.&nbsp; Your labour is paid for, if ye can so take heed, that no such
sentence be spoken to you; nay, we must all take heed lest these threatenings
one day take place in us.&nbsp; But lest the length of my sermon offend
you too sore, I will leave the rest of the parable and take me to the
handling of the end of it; that is, I will declare unto you how the
children of this world be more witty, crafty, and subtle, than are the
children of the light in their generation.&nbsp; Which sentence would
God it lay in my poor tongue to explicate with such light of words,
that I might seem rather to have painted it before your eyes, than to
have spoken it; and that you might rather seem to see the thing, than
to hear it!&nbsp; But I confess plainly this thing to be far above my
power.&nbsp; Therefore this being only left to me, I wish for that I
have not, and am sorry that that is not in me which I would so gladly
have, that is, power so to handle the thing that I have in hand, that
all that I say may turn to the glory of God, your souls&rsquo; health,
and the edifying of Christ&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; Wherefore I pray you
all to pray with me unto God, and that in your petition you desire,
that these two things he vouchsafe to grant us, first, a mouth for me
to speak rightly; next, ears for you, that in hearing me ye may take
profit at my hand: and that this may come to effect, you shall desire
him, unto whom our master Christ bad we should pray, saying even the
same prayer that he himself did institute.&nbsp; Wherein ye shall pray
for our most gracious sovereign lord the king, chief and supreme head
of the church of England under Christ, and for the most excellent, gracious,
and virtuous lady queen Jane, his most lawful wife, and for all his,
whether they be of the clergy or laity, whether they be of the nobility,
or else other his grace&rsquo;s subjects, not forgetting those that
being departed out of this transitory life, and now sleep in the sleep
of peace, and rest from their labours in quietness and peaceable sleep,
faithfully, lovingly, and patiently looking for that that they clearly
shall see when God shall be so pleased.&nbsp; For all these, and for
grace necessary, ye shall say unto God God&rsquo;s prayer, <i>Pater-noster</i>.</p>
<h3>THE SECOND SERMON, IN THE AFTERNOON.</h3>
<blockquote><p><i>Filii hujus seculi</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;Luc. xvi. [8].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Christ in this saying touched the sloth and sluggishness of his,
and did not allow the fraud and subtlety of others; neither was glad
that it was indeed as he had said, but complained rather that it should
be so: as many men speak many things, not that they ought to be so,
but that they are wont to be so.&nbsp; Nay, this grieved Christ, that
the children of this world should be of more policy than the children
of light; which thing was true in Christ&rsquo;s time, and now in our
time is most true.&nbsp; Who is so blind but he seeth this clearly;
except perchance there be any that cannot discern the children of the
world from the children of light?&nbsp; The children of the world conceive
and bring forth more prudently; and things conceived and brought forth
they nourish and conserve with much more policy than do the children
of light.&nbsp; Which thing is as sorrowful to be said, as it seemeth
absurd to be heard.&nbsp; When ye hear the children of the world, you
understand the world as a father.&nbsp; For the world is father of many
children, not by the first creation and work, but by imitation of love.&nbsp;
He is not only a father, but also the son of another father.&nbsp; If
ye know once his father, by and by ye shall know his children.&nbsp;
For he that hath the devil to his father, must needs have devilish children.&nbsp;
The devil is not only taken for father, but also for prince of the world,
that is, of worldly folk.&nbsp; It is either all one thing, or else
not much different, to say, children of the world, and children of the
devil; according to that that Christ said to the Jews, &ldquo;Ye are
of your father the devil:&rdquo; where as undoubtedly he spake to children
of this world.&nbsp; Now seeing the devil is both author and ruler of
the darkness, in the which the children of this world walk, or, to say
better, wander; they mortally hate both the light, and also the children
of light.&nbsp; And hereof it cometh, that the children of light never,
or very seldom, lack persecution in this world, unto which the children
of the world, that is, of the devil, bringeth them.&nbsp; And there
is no man but he seeth, that these use much more policy in procuring
the hurt and damage of the good, than those in defending themselves.&nbsp;
Therefore, brethren, gather you the disposition and study of the children
by the disposition and study of the fathers.&nbsp; Ye know this is a
proverb much used: &ldquo;An evil crow, an evil egg.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
the children of this world that are known to have so evil a father,
the world, so evil a grandfather, the devil, cannot choose but be evil.&nbsp;
Surely the first head of their ancestry was the deceitful serpent the
devil, a monster monstrous above all monsters.&nbsp; I cannot wholly
express him, I wot not what to call him, but a certain thing altogether
made of the hatred of God, of mistrust in God, of lyings, deceits, perjuries,
discords, manslaughters; and, to say at one word, a thing concrete,
heaped up and made of all kind of mischief.&nbsp; But what the devil
mean I to go about to describe particularly the devil&rsquo;s nature,
when no reason, no power of man&rsquo;s mind can comprehend it?&nbsp;
This alonely I can say grossly, and as in a sum, of the which all we
(our hurt is the more) have experience, the devil to be a stinking sentine
of all vices; a foul filthy channel of all mischiefs; and that this
world, his son, even a child meet to have such a parent, is not much
unlike his father.</p>
<p>Then, this devil being such one as can never be unlike himself; lo,
of Envy, his well-beloved Leman, he begat the World, and after left
it with Discord at nurse; which World, after that it came to man&rsquo;s
state, had of many concubines many sons.&nbsp; He was so fecund a father,
and had gotten so many children of Lady Pride, Dame Gluttony, Mistress
Avarice, Lady Lechery, and of Dame Subtlety, that now hard and scant
ye may find any corner, any kind of life, where many of his children
be not.&nbsp; In court, in cowls, in cloisters, in rochets, be they
never so white; yea, where shall ye not find them?&nbsp; Howbeit, they
that be secular and laymen, are not by and by children of the world;
nor they children of light, that are called spiritual, and of the clergy.&nbsp;
No, no; as ye may find among the laity many children of light, so among
the clergy, (how much soever we arrogate these holy titles unto us,
and think them only attributed to us, <i>Vos estis lux mundi, peculium
Christi, &amp;c</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye are the light of the world, the
chosen people of Christ, a kingly priesthood, an holy nation, and such
other,&rdquo;) ye shall find many children of the world; because in
all places the world getteth many children.&nbsp; Among the lay people
the world ceaseth not to bring to pass, that as they be called wordly,
so they are wordly indeed; driven headlong by worldly desires: insomuch
that they may right well seem to have taken as well the manners as the
name of their father.&nbsp; In the clergy, the world also hath learned
a way to make of men spiritual, worldlings; yea, and there also to form
worldly children, where with great pretence of holiness, and crafty
colour of religion, they utterly desire to hide and cloak the name of
the world, as though they were ashamed of their father; which do execrate
and detest the world (being nevertheless their father) in words and
outward signs, but in heart and work they coll and kiss him, and in
all their lives declare themselves to be his babes; insomuch that in
all worldly points they far pass and surmount those that they call seculars,
laymen, men of the world.&nbsp; The child so diligently followeth the
steps of his father, is never destitute of the aid of his grandfather.&nbsp;
These be our holy holy men, that say they are dead to the world, when
no men be more lively in worldly things than some of them be.&nbsp;
But let them be in profession and name most farthest from the world,
most alienate from it; yea, so far, that they may seem to have no occupying,
no kindred, no affinity, nothing to do with it: yet in their life and
deeds they shew themselves no bastards, but right begotten children
of the world; as that which the world long sithens had by his dear wife
Dame Hypocrisy, and since hath brought them up and multiplied to more
than a good many; increased them too much, albeit they swear by all
he-saints and she-saints too, that they know not their father, nor mother,
neither the world, nor hypocrisy; as indeed they can semble and dissemble
all things; which thing they might learn wonderful well of their parents.&nbsp;
I speak not of all religious men, but of those that the world hath fast
knit at his girdle, even in the midst of their religion, that is, of
many and more than many.&nbsp; For I fear, lest in all orders of men
the better, I must say the greater part of them be out of order, and
children of the world.&nbsp; Many of these might seem ingrate and unkind
children, that will no better acknowledge and recognise their parents
in words and outward pretence, but abrenounce and cast them off, as
though they hated them as dogs and serpents.&nbsp; Howbeit they, in
this wise, are most grateful to their parents, because they be most
like them, so lively representing them in countenance and conditions,
that their parents seem in them to be young again, forasmuch as they
ever say one thing and think another.&nbsp; They shew themselves to
be as sober, as temperate, as Curius the Roman was, and live every day
as though all their life were a shroving time.&nbsp; They be like their
parents, I say, inasmuch as they, in following them, seem and make men
believe they hate them.&nbsp; Thus grandfather Devil, father World,
and mother Hypocrisy, have brought them up.&nbsp; Thus good obedient
sons have borne away their parents&rsquo; commandments; neither these
be solitary, how religious, how mocking, how monking, I would say, soever
they be.</p>
<p>O ye will lay this to my charge, that <i>monachus</i> and <i>solitarius</i>
signifieth all one.&nbsp; I grant this to be so, yet these be so solitary
that they be not alone, but accompanied with great flocks of fraternities.&nbsp;
And I marvel if there be not a great sort of bishops and prelates, that
are brethren germain unto these; and as a great sort, so even as right
born, and world&rsquo;s children by as good title as they.&nbsp; But
because I cannot speak of all, when I say prelates, I understand bishops,
abbots, priors, archdeacons, deans, and other of such sort, that are
now called to this convocation, as I see, to entreat here of nothing
but of such matters as both appertain to the glory of Christ, and to
the wealth of the people of England.&nbsp; Which thing I pray God they
do as earnestly as they ought to do.&nbsp; But it is to be feared lest,
as light hath many her children here, so the world hath sent some of
his whelps hither; amongst the which I know there can be no concord
nor unity, albeit they be in one place, in one congregation.&nbsp; I
know there can be no agreement between these two, as long as they have
minds so unlike, and so contrary affections, judgments so utterly diverse
in all points.&nbsp; But if the children of this world be either more
in number, or more prudent than the children of light, what then availeth
us to have this convocation?&nbsp; Had it not been better we had not
been called together at all?&nbsp; For as the children of this world
be evil, so they breed and bring forth things evil; and yet there be
more of them in all places, or at the least they be more politic than
the children of light in their generation.&nbsp; And here I speak of
the generation whereby they do engender, and not of that whereby they
are engendered, because it should be too long to entreat how the children
of light are engendered, and how they come in at the door; and how the
children of the world be engendered, and come in another way.&nbsp;
Howbeit, I think all you that be here were not engendered after one
generation, neither that ye all came by your promotions after one manner:
God grant that ye, engendered worldly, do not engender worldly: and
as now I much pass not how ye were engendered, or by what means ye were
promoted to those dignities that ye now occupy, so it be honest, good
and profitable, that ye in this your consultation shall do and engender.</p>
<p>The end of your convocation shall shew what ye have done; the fruit
that shall come of your consultation shall shew what generation ye be
of.&nbsp; For what have ye done hitherto, I pray you, these seven years
and more?&nbsp; What have ye engendered?&nbsp; What have ye brought
forth?&nbsp; What fruit is come of your long and great assembly?&nbsp;
What one thing that the people of England hath been the better of a
hair; or you yourselves, either more accepted before God, or better
discharged toward the people committed unto your cure?&nbsp; For that
the people is better learned and taught now, than they were in time
past, to whether of these ought we to attribute it, to your industry,
or to the providence of God, and the foreseeing of the king&rsquo;s
grace!&nbsp; Ought we to thank you, or the king&rsquo;s highness?&nbsp;
Whether stirred other first, you the king, that he might preach, or
he you by his letters, that ye should preach oftener?&nbsp; Is it unknown,
think you, how both ye and your curates were, in [a] manner, by violence
enforced to let books to be made, not by you, but by profane and lay
persons; to let them, I say, be sold abroad, and read for the instruction
of the people?&nbsp; I am bold with you, but I speak Latin and not English,
to the clergy, not to the laity; I speak to you being present, and not
behind your backs.&nbsp; God is my witness, I speak whatsoever is spoken
of the good-will that I bear you; God is my witness, which knoweth my
heart, and compelleth me to say that I say.</p>
<p>Now, I pray you in God&rsquo;s name, what did you, so great fathers,
so many, so long a season, so oft assembled together?&nbsp; What went
you about?&nbsp; What would ye have brought to pass?&nbsp; Two things
taken away&mdash;the one, that ye (which I heard) burned a dead man;
the other, that ye (which I felt) went about to burn one being alive:
him, because he did, I cannot tell how, in his testament withstand your
profit; in other points, as I have heard, a very good man; reported
to be of an honest life while he lived, full of good works, good both
to the clergy, and also to the laity: this other, which truly never
hurt any of you, ye would have raked in the coals, because he would
not subscribe to certain articles that took away the supremacy of the
king:&mdash;take away these two noble acts, and there is nothing else
left that ye went about, that I know, saving that I now remember, that
somewhat ye attempted against Erasmus, albeit as yet nothing is come
to light.&nbsp; Ye have oft sat in consultation, but what have ye done?&nbsp;
Ye have had many things in deliberation, but what one is put forth,
whereby either Christ is more glorified, or else Christ&rsquo;s people
made more holy I appeal to your own conscience.&nbsp; How chanced this?&nbsp;
How came it thus?&nbsp; Because there were no children of light, no
children of God amongst you, which, setting the world at nought, would
study to illustrate the glory of God, and thereby shew themselves children
of light?&nbsp; I think not so, certainly I think not so.&nbsp; God
forbid, that all you, which were gathered together under the pretence
of light, should be children of the world!&nbsp; Then why happened this?&nbsp;
Why, I pray you?&nbsp; Perchance, either because the children of the
world were more in number in this your congregation, as it oft happeneth,
or at the least of more policy than the children of light in their generation:
whereby it might very soon be brought to pass, that these were much
more stronger in gendering the evil than these in producing the good.&nbsp;
The children of light have policy, but it is like the policy of the
serpent, and is joined with doveish simplicity.&nbsp; They engender
nothing but simply, faithfully, and plainly, even so doing all that
they do.&nbsp; And therefore they may with more facility be cumbered
in their engendering, and be the more ready to take injuries.&nbsp;
But the children of this world have worldly policy, foxly craft, lion-like
cruelty, power to do hurt, more than either <i>aspis</i> or <i>basiliscus</i>,
engendering and doing all things fraudulently, deceitfully, guilefully:
which as Nimrods and such sturdy and stout hunters, being full of simulation
and dissimulation before the Lord, deceive the children of light, and
cumber them easily.&nbsp; Hunters go not forth in every man&rsquo;s
sight, but do their affairs closely, and with use of guile and deceit
wax every day more craftier than other.</p>
<p>The children of this world be like crafty hunters; they be misnamed
children of light, forasmuch as they so hate light, and so study to
do the works of darkness.&nbsp; If they were the children of light,
they would not love darkness.&nbsp; It is no marvel that they go about
to keep other in darkness, seeing they be in darkness, from top to toe
overwhelmed with darkness, darker than is the darkness of hell.&nbsp;
Wherefore it is well done in all orders of men, but especial in the
order of prelates, to put a difference between children of light and
children of the world, because great deceit ariseth in taking the one
for the other.&nbsp; Great imposture cometh, when they that the common
people take for the light, go about to take the sun and the light out
of the world.&nbsp; But these be easily known, both by the diversity
of minds, and also their armours.&nbsp; For whereas the children of
light are thus minded, that they seek their adversaries&rsquo; health,
wealth, and profit, with loss of their own commodities, and ofttimes
with jeopardy of their life; the children of the world, contrariwise,
have such stomachs, that they will sooner see them dead that doth them
good, than sustain any loss of temporal things.&nbsp; The armour of
the children of light are, first, the word of God, which they ever set
forth, and with all diligence put it abroad, that, as much as in them
lieth, it may bring forth fruit: after this, patience and prayer, with
the which in all adversities the Lord comforteth them.&nbsp; Other things
they commit to God, unto whom they leave all revengement.&nbsp; The
armour of the children of the world are, sometime frauds and deceits,
sometime lies and money: by the first they make their dreams, their
traditions; by the second they stablish and confirm their dreams, be
they never so absurd, never so against scripture, honesty, or reason.&nbsp;
And if any man resist them, even with these weapons they procure to
slay him.&nbsp; Thus they bought Christ&rsquo;s death, the very light
itself, and obscured him after his death: thus they buy every day the
children of light, and obscure them, and shall so do, until the world
be at an end.&nbsp; So that it may be ever true, that Christ said: &ldquo;The
children of the world be wiser, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These worldlings pull down the lively faith, and full confidence
that men have in Christ, and set up another faith, another confidence,
of their own making: the children of light contrary.&nbsp; These worldlings
set little by such works as God hath prepared for our salvation, but
they extol traditions and works of their own invention: the children
of light contrary.&nbsp; The worldlings, if they spy profit, gains,
or lucre in any thing, be it never such a trifle, be it never so pernicious,
they preach it to the people (if they preach at any time), and these
things they defend with tooth and nail.&nbsp; They can scarce disallow
the abuses of these, albeit they be intolerable, lest in disallowing
the abuse they lose part of their profit.&nbsp; The children of the
light contrary, put all things in their degree, best highest, next next,
the worst lowest.&nbsp; They extol things necessary, Christian, and
commanded of God.&nbsp; They pull down will-works feigned by men, and
put them in their place.&nbsp; The abuses of all things they earnestly
rebuke.&nbsp; But yet these things be so done on both parties, and so
they both do gender, that the children of the world shew themselves
wiser than the children of light, and that frauds and deceits, lies
and money, seem evermore to have the upper hand.&nbsp; I hold my peace;
I will not say how fat feasts, and jolly banquets, be jolly instruments
to set forth worldly matters withal.&nbsp; Neither the children of the
world be only wiser than the children of light, but are also some of
them among themselves much wiser than the other in their generation.&nbsp;
For albeit, as touching the end, the generation of them all is one;
yet in this same generation some of them have more craftily engendered
than the other of their fellows.</p>
<p>For what a thing was that, that once every hundred year was brought
forth in Rome of the children of this world, and with how much policy
it was made, ye heard at Paul&rsquo;s Cross in the beginning of the
last parliament: how some brought forth canonizations, some expectations,
some pluralities and unions, some tot-quots and dispensations, some
pardons, and these of wonderful variety, some stationaries, some jubilaries,
some pocularies for drinkers, some manuaries for handlers of relicks,
some pedaries for pilgrims, some oscularies for kissers; some of them
engendered one, some other such fetures, and every one in that he was
delivered of, was excellent politic, wise; yea, so wise, that with their
wisdom they had almost made all the world fools.</p>
<p>But yet they that begot and brought forth that our old ancient purgatory
pick-purse; that that was swaged and cooled with a Franciscan&rsquo;s
cowl, put upon a dead man&rsquo;s back, to the fourth part of his sins;
that that was utterly to be spoiled, and of none other but of our most
prudent lord Pope, and of him as oft as him listed; that satisfactory,
that missal, that scalary: they, I say, that were the wise fathers and
genitors of this purgatory, were in my mind the wisest of all their
generation, and so far pass the children of light, and also the rest
of their company, that they both are but fools, if ye compare them with
these.&nbsp; It was a pleasant fiction, and from the beginning so profitable
to the feigners of it, that almost, I dare boldly say, there hath been
no emperor that hath gotten more by taxes and tallages of them that
were alive, than these, the very and right-begotten sons of the world,
got by dead men&rsquo;s tributes and gifts.&nbsp; If there be some in
England, that would this sweeting of the world to be with no less policy
kept still than it was born and brought forth in Rome, who then can
accuse Christ of lying?&nbsp; No, no; as it hath been ever true, so
it shall be, that the children of the world be much wiser, not only
in making their things, but also in conserving them.&nbsp; I wot not
what it is, but somewhat it is I wot, that some men be so loth to see
the abuse of this monster, purgatory, which abuse is more than abominable:
as who should say, there is none abuse in it, or else as though there
can be none in it.&nbsp; They may seem heartily to love the old thing,
that thus earnestly endeavour them to restore him his old name.&nbsp;
They would not set an hair by the name, but for the thing.&nbsp; They
be not so ignorant (no, they be crafty), but that they know if the name
come again, the thing will come after.&nbsp; Thereby it ariseth, that
some men make their cracks, that they, maugre all men&rsquo;s heads,
have found purgatory.&nbsp; I cannot tell what is found.&nbsp; This,
to pray for dead folks, this is not found, for it was never lost.&nbsp;
How can that be found that was not lost?&nbsp; O subtle finders, that
can find things, if God will, ere they be lost!&nbsp; For that cowlish
deliverance, their scalary losings, their papal spoliations, and other
such their figments, they cannot find.&nbsp; No, these be so lost, as
they themselves grant, that though they seek them never so diligently,
yet they shall not find them, except perchance they hope to see them
come in again with their names; and that then money-gathering may return
again, and deceit walk about the country, and so stablish their kingdom
in all kingdoms.&nbsp; But to what end this chiding between the children
of the world and the children of light will come, only he knoweth that
once shall judge them both.</p>
<p>Now, to make haste and to come somewhat nigher the end.&nbsp; Go
ye to, good brethren and fathers, for the love of God, go ye to; and
seeing we are here assembled, let us do something whereby we may be
known to be the children of light.&nbsp; Let us do somewhat, lest we,
which hitherto have been judged children of the world, seem even still
to be so.&nbsp; All men call us prelates: then, seeing we be in council,
let us so order ourselves, that we be prelates in honour and dignity;
so we may be prelates in holiness, benevolence, diligence, and sincerity.&nbsp;
All men know that we be here gathered, and with most fervent desire
they anheale, breathe, and gape for the fruit of our convocation: as
our acts shall be, so they shall name us: so that now it lieth in us,
whether we will be called children of the world, or children of light.</p>
<p>Wherefore lift up your heads, brethren, and look about with your
eyes, spy what things are to be reformed in the church of England.&nbsp;
Is it so hard, is it so great a matter for you to see many abuses in
the clergy, many in the laity?&nbsp; What is done in the Arches?&nbsp;
Nothing to be amended?&nbsp; What do they there?&nbsp; Do they evermore
rid the people&rsquo;s business and matters, or cumber and ruffle them?&nbsp;
Do they evermore correct vice, or else defend it, sometime being well
corrected in other places?&nbsp; How many sentences be given there in
time, as they ought to be?&nbsp; If men say truth, how many without
bribes?&nbsp; Or if all things be well done there, what do men in bishops&rsquo;
Consistories?&nbsp; Shall you often see the punishments assigned by
the laws executed, or else money-redemptions used in their stead?&nbsp;
How think you by the ceremonies that are in England, oft times, with
no little offence of weak consciences, contemned; more oftener with
superstition so defiled, and so depraved, that you may doubt whether
it were better some of them to tarry still, or utterly to take them
away?&nbsp; Have not our forefathers complained of the ceremonies, of
the superstition, and estimation of them?</p>
<p>Do ye see nothing in our holidays? of the which very few were made
at the first, and they to set forth goodness, virtue, and honesty: but
sithens, in some places, there is neither mean nor measure in making
new holidays, as who should say, this one thing is serving of God, to
make this law, that no man may work.&nbsp; But what doth the people
on these holidays?&nbsp; Do they give themselves to godliness, or else
ungodliness?&nbsp; See ye nothing, brethren?&nbsp; If you see not, yet
God seeth.&nbsp; God seeth all the whole holidays to be spent miserably
in drunkenness, in glossing, in strife, in envy, in dancing, dicing,
idleness, and gluttony.&nbsp; He seeth all this, and threateneth punishment
for it.&nbsp; He seeth it, which neither is deceived in seeing, nor
deceiveth when he threateneth.</p>
<p>Thus men serve the devil; for God is not thus served, albeit ye say
ye serve God.&nbsp; No, the devil hath more service done unto him on
one holiday, than on many working days.&nbsp; Let all these abuses be
counted as nothing, who is he that is not sorry, to see in so many holidays
rich and wealthy persons to flow in delicates, and men that live by
their travail, poor men, to lack necessary meat and drink for their
wives and their children, and that they cannot labour upon the holidays,
except they will be cited, and brought before our Officials?&nbsp; Were
it not the office of good prelates to consult upon these matters, and
to seek some remedy for them?&nbsp; Ye shall see, my brethren, ye shall
see once, what will come of this our winking.</p>
<p>What think ye of these images that are had more than their fellows
in reputation; that are gone unto with such labour and weariness of
the body, frequented with such our cost, sought out and visited with
such confidence?&nbsp; What say ye by these images, that are so famous,
so noble, so noted, being of them so many and so divers in England?&nbsp;
Do you think that this preferring of picture to picture, image to image,
is the right use, and not rather the abuse, of images?&nbsp; But you
will say to me, Why make ye all these interrogations? and why, in these
your demands, do you let and withdraw the good devotion of the people?&nbsp;
Be not all things well done, that are done with good intent, when they
be profitable to us?&nbsp; So, surely, covetousness both thinketh and
speaketh.&nbsp; Were it not better for us, more for estimation, more
meeter for men in our places, to cut away a piece of this our profit,
if we will not cut away all, than to wink at such ungodliness, and so
long to wink for a little lucre; specially if it be ungodliness, and
also seem unto you ungodliness?&nbsp; These be two things, so oft to
seek mere images, and sometime to visit the relicks of saints.&nbsp;
And yet, as in those there may be much ungodliness committed, so there
may here some superstition be hid, if that sometime we chance to visit
pigs&rsquo; bones instead of saints&rsquo; relicks, as in time past
it hath chanced, I had almost said, in England.&nbsp; Then this is too
great a blindness, a darkness too sensible, that these should be so
commended in sermons of some men, and preached to be done after such
manner, as though they could not be evil done; which, notwithstanding,
are such, that neither God nor man commandeth them to be done.&nbsp;
No, rather, men commanded them either not to be done at all, or else
more slowlier and seldomer to be done, forasmuch as our ancestors made
this constitution: &ldquo;We command the priests that they oft admonish
the people, and in especial women, that they make no vows but after
long deliberation, consent of their husbands and counsel of the priest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The church of England in time past made this constitution.&nbsp; What
saw they that made this decree?&nbsp; They saw the intolerable abuses
of images.&nbsp; They saw the perils that might ensue of going on pilgrimage.&nbsp;
They saw the superstitious difference that men made between image and
image.&nbsp; Surely, somewhat they saw.&nbsp; The constitution is so
made, that in manner it taketh away all such pilgrimages.&nbsp; For
it so plucketh away the abuse of them, that it leaveth either none or
else seldom use of them.&nbsp; For they that restrain making vows for
going of pilgrimage, restrain also pilgrimage; seeing that for the most
part it is seen that few go on pilgrimage but vow-makers, and such as
by promise bind themselves to go.&nbsp; And when, I pray you, should
a man&rsquo;s wife go on pilgrimage, if she went not before she had
well debated the matter with herself, and obtained the consent of her
husband, being a wise man, and were also counselled by a learned priest
so to do?&nbsp; When should she go far off to these famous images?&nbsp;
For this the common people of England think to be going on pilgrimage;
to go to some dead and notable image out of town, that is to say, far
from their house.&nbsp; Now if your forefathers made this constitution,
and yet thereby did nothing, the abuses every day more and more increased,
what is left for you to do?&nbsp; Brethren and fathers, if ye purpose
to do any thing, what should ye sooner do, than to take utterly away
these deceitful and juggling images; or else, if ye know any other mean
to put away abuses, to shew it, if ye intend to remove abuses?&nbsp;
Methink it should be grateful and pleasant to you to mark the earnest
mind of your forefathers, and to look upon their desire where they say
in their constitution, &ldquo;We <i>command</i> you,&rdquo; and not,
&ldquo;We <i>counsel</i> you.&rdquo;&nbsp; How have we been so long
a-cold, so long slack in setting forth so wholesome a precept of the
church of England, where we be so hot in all things that have any gains
in them, albeit they be neither commanded us, nor yet given us by counsel;
as though we had lever the abuse of things should tarry still than,
it taken away, lose our profit?&nbsp; To let pass the solemn and nocturnal
bacchanals, the prescript miracles, that are done upon certain days
in the west part of England, who hath not heard?&nbsp; I think ye have
heard of St. Blesis&rsquo;s heart which is at Malverne, and of St. Algar&rsquo;s
bones, how long they deluded the people: I am afraid, to the loss of
many souls.&nbsp; Whereby men may well conjecture, that all about in
this realm there is plenty of such juggling deceits.&nbsp; And yet hitherto
ye have sought no remedy.&nbsp; But even still the miserable people
are suffered to take the false miracles for the true, and to lie still
asleep in all kind of superstition.&nbsp; God have mercy upon us!</p>
<p>Last of all, how think you of matrimony?&nbsp; Is all well here?&nbsp;
What of baptism?&nbsp; Shall we evermore in ministering of it speak
Latin, and not in English rather, that the people may know what is said
and done?</p>
<p>What think ye of these mass-priests, and of the masses themselves?&nbsp;
What say ye?&nbsp; Be all things here so without abuses, that nothing
ought to be amended?&nbsp; Your forefathers saw somewhat, which made
this constitution against the venality and sale of masses, that, under
pain of suspending, no priest should sell his saying of tricennals or
annals.&nbsp; What saw they, that made this constitution?&nbsp; What
priests saw they?&nbsp; What manner of masses saw they, trow ye?&nbsp;
But at the last, what became of so good a constitution?&nbsp; God have
mercy upon us!&nbsp; If there be nothing to be amended abroad, concerning
the whole, let every one of us make one better: if there be neither
abroad nor at home any thing to be amended and redressed, my lords,
be ye of good cheer, be merry; and at the least, because we have nothing
else to do, let us reason the matter how we may be richer.&nbsp; Let
us fall to some pleasant communication; after let us go home, even as
good as we came hither, that is, right-begotten children of the world,
and utterly worldlings.&nbsp; And while we live here, let us all make
bone cheer.&nbsp; For after this life there is small pleasure, little
mirth for us to hope for; if now there be nothing to be changed in our
fashions.&nbsp; Let us say, not as St. Peter did, &ldquo;Our end approacheth
nigh,&rdquo; this is an heavy hearing; but let us say as the evil servant
said, &ldquo;It will be long ere my master come.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is
pleasant.&nbsp; Let us beat our fellows: let us eat and drink with drunkards.&nbsp;
Surely, as oft as we do not take away the abuse of things, so oft we
beat our fellows.&nbsp; As oft as we give not the people their true
food, so oft we beat our fellows.&nbsp; As oft as we let them die in
superstition, so oft we beat them.&nbsp; To be short, as oft as we blind
lead them blind, so oft we beat, and grievously beat our fellows.&nbsp;
When we welter in pleasures and idleness, then we eat and drink with
drunkards.&nbsp; But God will come, God will come, he will not tarry
long away.&nbsp; He will come upon such a day as we nothing look for
him, and at such hour as we know not.&nbsp; He will come and cut us
in pieces.&nbsp; He will reward us as he doth the hypocrites.&nbsp;
He will set us where wailing shall be, my brethren; where gnashing of
teeth shall be, my brethren.&nbsp; And let here be the end of our tragedy,
if ye will.&nbsp; These be the delicate dishes prepared for the world&rsquo;s
well-beloved children.&nbsp; These be the wafers and junkets provided
for worldly prelates&mdash;wailing and gnashing of teeth.&nbsp; Can
there be any mirth, where these two courses last all the feast?&nbsp;
Here we laugh, there we shall weep.&nbsp; Our teeth make merry here,
ever dashing in delicates; there we shall be torn with teeth, and do
nothing but gnash and grind our own.&nbsp; To what end have we now excelled
other in policy?&nbsp; What have we brought forth at the last?&nbsp;
Ye see, brethren, what sorrow, what punishment is provided for you,
if ye be worldlings.&nbsp; If ye will not thus be vexed, be ye not the
children of the world.&nbsp; If ye will not be the children of the world,
be not stricken with the love of worldly things; lean not upon them.&nbsp;
If ye will not die eternally, live not worldly.&nbsp; Come, go to; leave
the love of your profit; study for the glory and profit of Christ; seek
in your consultations such things as pertain to Christ, and bring forth
at the last somewhat that may please Christ.&nbsp; Feed ye tenderly,
with all diligence, the flock of Christ.&nbsp; Preach truly the word
of God.&nbsp; Love the light, walk in the light, and so be ye the children
of light while ye are in this world, that ye may shine in the world
that is to come bright as the sun, with the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost; to whom be all honour, praise, and glory.&nbsp; Amen.</p>
<h2>A SERMON OF THE REVEREND FATHER MASTER HUGH LATIMER, PREACHED IN
THE SHROUDS AT ST. PAUL&rsquo;S CHURCH IN LONDON, ON THE EIGHTEENTH
DAY OF JANUARY, ANNO 1548.</h2>
<blockquote><p><i>Qu&aelig;unque scripta sunt ad nostram doctrinam scripta
sunt</i>.&mdash;Rom. xv. 4.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All things which are written, are written for our erudition
and knowledge.&nbsp; All things that are written in God&rsquo;s book,
in the Bible book, in the book of the holy scripture, are written to
be our doctrine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I told you in my first sermon, honourable audience, that I purposed
to declare unto you two things.&nbsp; The one, what seed should be sown
in God&rsquo;s field, in God&rsquo;s plough land; and the other, who
should be the sowers: that is to say, what doctrine is to be taught
in Christ&rsquo;s church and congregation, and what men should be the
teachers and preachers of it.&nbsp; The first part I have told you in
the three sermons past, in which I have assayed to set forth my plough,
to prove what I could do.&nbsp; And now I shall tell you who be the
ploughers: for God&rsquo;s word is a seed to be sown in God&rsquo;s
field, that is, the faithful congregation, and the preacher is the sower.&nbsp;
And it is in the gospel: <i>Exivit qui seminat seminare semen suum</i>;
&ldquo;He that soweth, the husbandman, the ploughman, went forth to
sow his seed.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that a preacher is resembled to a ploughman,
as it is in another place: <i>Nemo admota aratro manu, et a tergo respiciens,
aptus est regno Dei</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;No man that putteth his hand to
the plough, and looketh back, is apt for the kingdom of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That is to say, let no preacher be negligent in doing his office.&nbsp;
Albeit this is one of the places that hath been racked, as I told you
of racking scriptures.&nbsp; And I have been one of them myself that
hath racked it, I cry God mercy for it; and have been one of them that
have believed and expounded it against religious persons that would
forsake their order which they had professed, and would go out of their
cloister: whereas indeed it toucheth not monkery, nor maketh any thing
at all for any such matter; but it is directly spoken of diligent preaching
of the word of God.</p>
<p>For preaching of the gospel is one of God&rsquo;s plough-works, and
the preacher is one of God&rsquo;s ploughmen.&nbsp; Ye may not be offended
with my similitude, in that I compare preaching to the labour and work
of ploughing, and the preacher to a ploughman: ye may not be offended
with this my similitude; for I have been slandered of some persons for
such things.&nbsp; It hath been said of me, &ldquo;Oh, Latimer! nay,
as for him, I will never believe him while I live, nor never trust him;
for he likened our blessed lady to a saffron-bag:&rdquo; where indeed
I never used that similitude.&nbsp; But it was, as I have said unto
you before now, according to that which Peter saw before in the spirit
of prophecy, and said, that there should come after men <i>per quos
via veritatis maledictis afficeretur</i>; there should come fellows
&ldquo;by whom the way of truth should be evil spoken of, and slandered.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But in case I had used this similitude, it had not been to be reproved,
but might have been without reproach.&nbsp; For I might have said thus:
as the saffron-bag that hath been full of saffron, or hath had saffron
in it, doth ever after savour and smell of the sweet saffron that it
contained; so our blessed lady, which conceived and bare Christ in her
womb, did ever after resemble the manners and virtues of that precious
babe that she bare.&nbsp; And what had our blessed lady been the worse
for this? or what dishonour was this to our blessed lady?&nbsp; But
as preachers must be wary and circumspect, that they give not any just
occasion to be slandered and ill spoken of by the hearers, so must not
the auditors be offended without cause.&nbsp; For heaven is in the gospel
likened to a mustard-seed: it is compared also to a piece of leaven;
and as Christ saith, that at the last day he will come like a thief:
and what dishonour is this to God? or what derogation is this to heaven?&nbsp;
Ye may not then, I say, be offended with my similitude, for because
I liken preaching to a ploughman&rsquo;s labour, and a prelate to a
ploughman.&nbsp; But now you will ask me, whom I call a prelate?&nbsp;
A prelate is that man, whatsoever he be, that hath a flock to be taught
of him; whosoever hath any spiritual charge in the faithful congregation,
and whosoever he be that hath cure of souls.&nbsp; And well may the
preacher and the ploughman be likened together: first, for their labour
of all seasons of the year; for there is no time of the year in which
the ploughman hath not some special work to do: as in my country in
Leicestershire, the ploughman hath a time to set forth, and to assay
his plough, and other times for other necessary works to be done.&nbsp;
And then they also maybe likened together for the diversity of works
and variety of offices that they have to do.&nbsp; For as the ploughman
first setteth forth his plough, and then tilleth his land, and breaketh
it in furrows, and sometime ridgeth it up again; and at another time
harroweth it and clotteth it, and sometime dungeth it and hedgeth it,
diggeth it and weedeth it, purgeth and maketh it clean: so the prelate,
the preacher, hath many diverse offices to do.&nbsp; He hath first a
busy work to bring his parishioners to a right faith, as Paul calleth
it, and not a swerving faith; but to a faith that embraceth Christ,
and trusteth to his merits; a lively faith, a justifying faith; a faith
that maketh a man righteous, without respect of works: as ye have it
very well declared and set forth in the Homily.&nbsp; He hath then a
busy work, I say, to bring his flock to a right faith, and then to confirm
them in the same faith: now casting them down with the law, and with
threatenings of God for sin; now ridging them up again with the gospel,
and with the promises of God&rsquo;s favour: now weeding them, by telling
them their faults, and making them forsake sin; now clotting them, by
breaking their stony hearts, and by making them supplehearted, and making
them to have hearts of flesh; that is, soft hearts, and apt for doctrine
to enter in: now teaching to know God rightly, and to know their duty
to God and their neighbours: now exhorting them, when they know their
duty, that they do it, and be diligent in it; so that they have a continual
work to do.&nbsp; Great is their business, and therefore great should
be their hire.&nbsp; They have great labours, and therefore they ought
to have good livings, that they may commodiously feed their flock; for
the preaching of the word of God unto the people is called meat: scripture
calleth it meat; not strawberries, that come but once a year, and tarry
not long, but are soon gone: but it is meat, it is no dainties.&nbsp;
The people must have meat that must be familiar and continual, and daily
given unto them to feed upon.&nbsp; Many make a strawberry of it, ministering
it but once a year; but such do not the office of good prelates.&nbsp;
For Christ saith, <i>Quis putas est servus prudens et fidelis</i>?&nbsp;
<i>Qui dat cibum in tempore</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who think you is a wise
and faithful servant?&nbsp; He that giveth meat in due time.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So that he must at all times convenient preach diligently: therefore
saith he, &ldquo;Who trow ye is a faithful servant?&rdquo;&nbsp; He
speaketh it as though it were a rare thing to find such a one, and as
though he should say, there be but a few of them to find in the world.&nbsp;
And how few of them there be throughout this realm that give meat to
their flock as they should do, the Visitors can best tell.&nbsp; Too
few, too few; the more is the pity, and never so few as now.</p>
<p>By this, then, it appeareth that a prelate, or any that hath cure
of soul, must diligently and substantially work and labour.&nbsp; Therefore
saith Paul to Timothy, <i>Qui episcopatum desiderat, hic bonum opus
desiderat</i>: &ldquo;He that desireth to have the office of a bishop,
or a prelate, that man desireth a good work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then if it
be a good work, it is work; ye can make but a work of it.&nbsp; It is
God&rsquo;s work, God&rsquo;s plough, and that plough God would have
still going.&nbsp; Such then as loiter and live idly, are not good prelates,
or ministers.&nbsp; And of such as do not preach and teach, nor do their
duties, God saith by his prophet Jeremy, <i>Maledictus qui facit opus
Dei fraudulenter</i>; &ldquo;Cursed be the man that doth the work of
God fraudulently, guilefully or deceitfully:&rdquo; some books have
it <i>negligenter</i>, &ldquo;negligently or slackly.&rdquo;&nbsp; How
many such prelates, how many such bishops, Lord, for thy mercy, are
there now in England!&nbsp; And what shall we in this case do? shall
we company with them?&nbsp; O Lord, for thy mercy! shall we not company
with them?&nbsp; O Lord, whither shall we flee from them?&nbsp; But
&ldquo;cursed be he that doth the work of God negligently or guilefully.&rdquo;&nbsp;
A sore word for them that are negligent in discharging their office,
or have done it fraudulently; for that is the thing that maketh the
people ill.</p>
<p>But true it must be that Christ saith, <i>Multi sunt vocati, pauci
vero electi</i>: &ldquo;Many are called, but few are chosen.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here have I an occasion by the way somewhat to say unto you; yea, for
the place I alleged unto you before out of Jeremy, the forty-eighth
chapter.&nbsp; And it was spoken of a spiritual work of God, a work
that was commanded to be done; and it was of shedding blood, and of
destroying the cities of Moab.&nbsp; For, saith he, &ldquo;Cursed be
he that keepeth back his sword from shedding of blood.&rdquo;&nbsp;
As Saul, when he kept back the sword from shedding of blood at what
time he was sent against Amaleck, was refused of God for being disobedient
to God&rsquo;s commandment, in that he spared Agag the king.&nbsp; So
that that place of the prophet was spoken of them that went to the destruction
of the cities of Moab, among the which there was one called Nebo, which
was much reproved for idolatry, superstition, pride, avarice, cruelty,
tyranny, and for hardness of heart; and for these sins was plagued of
God and destroyed.</p>
<p>Now what shall we say of these rich citizens of London?&nbsp; What
shall I say of them?&nbsp; Shall I call them proud men of London, malicious
men of London, merciless men of London?&nbsp; No, no, I may not say
so; they will be offended with me then.&nbsp; Yet must I speak.&nbsp;
For is there not reigning in London as much pride, as much covetousness,
as much cruelty, as much oppression, and as much superstition, as was
in Nebo?&nbsp; Yes, I think, and much more too.&nbsp; Therefore I say,
repent, O London; repent, repent.&nbsp; Thou hearest thy faults told
thee, amend them, amend them.&nbsp; I think, if Nebo had had the preaching
that thou hast, they would have converted.&nbsp; And, you rulers and
officers, be wise and circumspect, look to your charge, and see you
do your duties; and rather be glad to amend your ill living than to
be angry when you are warned or told of your fault.&nbsp; What ado was
there made in London at a certain man, because he said, (and indeed
at that time on a just cause,) &ldquo;Burgesses!&rdquo; quoth he, &ldquo;nay,
Butterflies.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord, what ado there was for that word!&nbsp;
And yet would God they were no worse than butterflies!&nbsp; Butterflies
do but their nature: the butterfly is not covetous, is not greedy, of
other men&rsquo;s goods; is not full of envy and hatred, is not malicious,
is not cruel, is not merciless.&nbsp; The butterfly glorieth not in
her own deeds, nor preferreth the traditions of men before God&rsquo;s
word; it committeth not idolatry, nor worshippeth false gods.&nbsp;
But London cannot abide to be rebuked; such is the nature of man.&nbsp;
If they be pricked, they will kick; if they be rubbed on the gall, they
will wince; but yet they will not amend their faults, they will not
be ill spoken of.&nbsp; But how shall I speak well of them?&nbsp; If
you could be content to receive and follow the word of God, and favour
good preachers, if you could bear to be told of your faults, if you
could amend when you hear of them, if you would be glad to reform that
is amiss; if I might see any such inclination in you, that you would
leave to be merciless, and begin to be charitable, I would then hope
well of you, I would then speak well of you.&nbsp; But London was never
so ill as it is now.&nbsp; In times past men were full of pity and compassion,
but now there is no pity; for in London their brother shall die in the
streets for cold, he shall lie sick at the door between stock and stock,
I cannot tell what to call it, and perish there for hunger: was there
ever more unmercifulness in Nebo?&nbsp; I think not.&nbsp; In times
past, when any rich man died in London, they were wont to help the poor
scholars of the Universities with exhibition.&nbsp; When any man died,
they would bequeath great sums of money toward the relief of the poor.&nbsp;
When I was a scholar in Cambridge myself; I heard very good report of
London, and knew many that had relief of the rich men of London: but
now I can hear no such good report, and yet I inquire of it, and hearken
for it; but now charity is waxen cold, none helpeth the scholar, nor
yet the poor.&nbsp; And in those days, what did they when they helped
the scholars?&nbsp; Marry, they maintained and gave them livings that
were very papists, and professed the pope&rsquo;s doctrine: and now
that the knowledge of God&rsquo;s word is brought to light, and many
earnestly study and labour to set it forth, now almost no man helpeth
to maintain them.</p>
<p>Oh London, London! repent, repent; for I think God is more displeased
with London than ever he was with the city of Nebo.&nbsp; Repent therefore,
repent, London, and remember that the same God liveth now that punished
Nebo, even the same God, and none other; and he will punish sin as well
now as he did then: and he will punish the iniquity of London, as well
as he did then of Nebo.&nbsp; Amend therefore.&nbsp; And ye that be
prelates, look well to your office, for right prelating is busy labouring,
and not lording.&nbsp; Therefore preach and teach, and let your plough
be doing.&nbsp; Ye lords, I say, that live like loiterers, look well
to your office; the plough is your office and charge.&nbsp; If you live
idle and loiter, you do not your duty, you follow not your vocation:
let your plough therefore be going, and not cease, that the ground may
bring forth fruit.</p>
<p>But now methinketh I hear one say unto me: Wot ye what you say?&nbsp;
Is it a work?&nbsp; Is it a labour?&nbsp; How then hath it happened
that we have had so many hundred years so many unpreaching prelates,
lording loiterers, and idle ministers?&nbsp; Ye would have me here to
make answer, and to show cause thereof.&nbsp; Nay, this land is not
for me to plough; it is too stony, too thorny, too hard for me to plough.&nbsp;
They have so many things that make for them, so many things to lay for
themselves, that it is not for my weak team to plough them.&nbsp; They
have to lay for themselves long customs, ceremonies and authority, placing
in parliament, and many things more.&nbsp; And I fear me this land is
not yet ripe to be ploughed: for, as the saying is, it lacketh weathering:
this gear lacketh weathering; at least way it is not for me to plough.&nbsp;
For what shall I look for among thorns, but pricking and scratching?&nbsp;
What among stones, but stumbling?&nbsp; What (I had almost said) among
serpents, but stinging?&nbsp; But this much I dare say, that since lording
and loitering hath come up, preaching hath come down, contrary to the
apostles&rsquo; times: for they preached and lorded not, and now they
lord and preach not.&nbsp; For they that be lords will ill go to plough:
it is no meet office for them; it is not seeming for their estate.&nbsp;
Thus came up lording loiterers: thus crept in unpreaching prelates;
and so have they long continued.&nbsp; For how many unlearned prelates
have we now at this day!&nbsp; And no marvel: for if the ploughmen that
now be were made lords, they would clean give over ploughing; they would
leave off their labour, and fall to lording outright, and let the plough
stand: and then both ploughs not walking, nothing should be in the commonweal
but hunger.&nbsp; For ever since the prelates were made lords and nobles,
the plough standeth; there is no work done, the people starve.&nbsp;
They hawk, they hunt, they card, they dice; they pastime in their prelacies
with gallant gentlemen, with their dancing minions, and with their fresh
companions, so that ploughing is set aside: and by their lording and
loitering, preaching and ploughing is clean gone.&nbsp; And thus if
the ploughmen of the country were as negligent in their office as prelates
be, we should not long live, for lack of sustenance.&nbsp; And as it
is necessary for to have this ploughing for the sustentation of the
body, so must we have also the other for the satisfaction of the soul,
or else we cannot live long ghostly.&nbsp; For as the body wasteth and
consumeth away for lack of bodily meat, so doth the soul pine away for
default of ghostly meat.&nbsp; But there be two kinds of inclosing,
to let or hinder both these kinds of ploughing: the one is an inclosing
to let or hinder the bodily ploughing, and the other to let or hinder
the holiday-ploughing, the church-ploughing.</p>
<p>The bodily ploughing is taken in and inclosed through singular commodity.&nbsp;
For what man will let go, or diminish his private commodity for a commonwealth?&nbsp;
And who will sustain any damage for the respect of a public commodity?&nbsp;
The other plough also no man is diligent to set forward, nor no man
will hearken to it.&nbsp; But to hinder and let it all men&rsquo;s ears
are open; yea, and a great many of this kind of ploughmen, which are
very busy, and would seem to be very good workmen.&nbsp; I fear me some
be rather mock-gospellers, than faithful ploughmen.&nbsp; I know many
myself that profess the gospel, and live nothing thereafter.&nbsp; I
know them, and have been conversant with some of them.&nbsp; I know
them, and (I speak it with a heavy heart) there is as little charity
and good living in them as in any other; according to that which Christ
said in the gospel to the great number of people that followed him,
as though they had had any earnest zeal to his doctrine, whereas indeed
they had it not; <i>Non quia vidistis signa, sed quia comedistis de
panibus</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye follow me,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;not
because ye have seen the signs and miracles that I have done; but because
ye have eaten the bread, and refreshed your bodies, therefore you follow
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that I think many one now-a-days professeth the
gospel for the living&rsquo;s sake, not for the love they bear to God&rsquo;s
word.&nbsp; But they that will be true ploughmen must work faithfully
for God&rsquo;s sake, for the edifying of their brethren.&nbsp; And
as diligently as the husbandman plougheth for the sustentation of the
body, so diligently must the prelates and ministers labour for the feeding
of the soul: both the ploughs must still be going, as most necessary
for man.&nbsp; And wherefore are magistrates ordained, but that the
tranquillity of the commonweal may be confirmed, limiting both ploughs?</p>
<p>But now for the fault of unpreaching prelates, methink I could guess
what might be said for excusing of them.&nbsp; They are so troubled
with lordly living, they be so placed in palaces, crouched in courts,
ruffling in their rents, dancing in their dominions, burdened with ambassages,
pampering of their paunches, like a monk that maketh his jubilee; munching
in their mangers, and moiling in their gay manors and mansions, and
so troubled with loitering in their lordships, that they cannot attend
it.&nbsp; They are otherwise occupied, some in king&rsquo;s matters,
some are ambassadors, some of the privy council, some to furnish the
court, some are lords of the parliament, some are presidents, and comptrollers
of mints.</p>
<p>Well, well, is this their duty?&nbsp; Is this their office?&nbsp;
Is this their calling?&nbsp; Should we have ministers of the church
to be comptrollers of the mints?&nbsp; Is this a meet office for a priest
that hath cure of souls?&nbsp; Is this his charge?&nbsp; I would here
ask one question: I would fain know who controlleth the devil at home
in his parish, while he controlleth the mint?&nbsp; If the apostles
might not leave the office of preaching to the deacons, shall one leave
it for minting?&nbsp; I cannot tell you; but the saying is, that since
priests have been minters, money hath been worse than it was before.&nbsp;
And they say that the evilness of money hath made all things dearer.&nbsp;
And in this behalf I must speak to England.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hear, my country,
England,&rdquo; as Paul said in his first epistle to the Corinthians,
the sixth chapter; for Paul was no sitting bishop, but a walking and
a preaching bishop.&nbsp; But when he went from them, he left there
behind him the plough going still; for he wrote unto them, and rebuked
them for going to law, and pleading their causes before heathen judges:
&ldquo;Is there,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;utterly among you no wise man,
to be an arbitrator in matters of judgment?&nbsp; What, not one of all
that can judge between brother and brother; but one brother goeth to
law with another, and that under heathen judges?&nbsp; <i>Constituite
contemptos qui sunt in ecclesia</i>, &amp;c.&nbsp; Appoint them judges
that are most abject and vile in the congregation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which
he speaketh in rebuking them; &ldquo;For,&rdquo; saith he, <i>ad erubescentiam
vestram dico</i>&mdash;&ldquo;I speak it to your shame.&rdquo;&nbsp;
So, England, I speak it to thy shame: is there never a nobleman to be
a lord president, but it must be a prelate?&nbsp; Is there never a wise
man in the realm to be a comptroller of the mint?&nbsp; I speak it to
your shame.&nbsp; I speak it to your shame.&nbsp; If there be never
a wise man, make a water-bearer, a tinker, a cobbler, a slave, a page,
comptroller of the mint: make a mean gentleman, a groom, a yeoman, or
a poor beggar, lord president.</p>
<p>Thus I speak, not that I would have it so; but &ldquo;to your shame,&rdquo;
if there be never a gentleman meet nor able to be lord president.&nbsp;
For why are not the noblemen and young gentlemen of England so brought
up in knowledge of God, and in learning, that they may be able to execute
offices in the commonweal?&nbsp; The king hath a great many of wards,
and I trow there is a Court of Wards: why is there not a school for
the wards, as well as there is a Court for their lands?&nbsp; Why are
they not set in schools where they may learn?&nbsp; Or why are they
not sent to the universities, that they may be able to serve the king
when they come to age?&nbsp; If the wards and young gentlemen were well
brought up in learning, and in the knowledge of God, they would not
when they come to age so much give themselves to other vanities.&nbsp;
And if the nobility be well trained in godly learning, the people would
follow the same train.&nbsp; For truly, such as the noblemen be, such
will the people be.&nbsp; And now, the only cause why noblemen be not
made lord presidents, is because they have not been brought up in learning.</p>
<p>Therefore for the love of God appoint teachers and schoolmasters,
you that have charge of youth; and give the teachers stipends worthy
their pains, that they may bring them up in grammar, in logic, in rhetoric,
in philosophy, in the civil law, and in that which I cannot leave unspoken
of, the word of God.&nbsp; Thanks be unto God, the nobility otherwise
is very well brought up in learning and godliness, to the great joy
and comfort of England; so that there is now good hope in the youth,
that we shall another day have a flourishing commonweal, considering
their godly education.&nbsp; Yea, and there be already noblemen enough,
though not so many as I could wish, able to be lord presidents, and
wise men enough for the mint.&nbsp; And as unmeet a thing it is for
bishops to be lord presidents, or priests to be minters, as it was for
the Corinthians to plead matters of variance before heathen judges.&nbsp;
It is also a slander to the noblemen, as though they lacked wisdom and
learning to be able for such offices, or else were no men of conscience,
or else were not meet to be trusted, and able for such offices.&nbsp;
And a prelate hath a charge and cure otherwise; and therefore he cannot
discharge his duty and be a lord president too.&nbsp; For a presidentship
requireth a whole man; and a bishop cannot be two men.&nbsp; A bishop
hath his office, a flock to teach, to look unto; and therefore he cannot
meddle with another office, which alone requireth a whole man: he should
therefore give it over to whom it is meet, and labour in his own business;
as Paul writeth to the Thessalonians, &ldquo;Let every man do his own
business, and follow his calling.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let the priest preach,
and the noblemen handle the temporal matters.&nbsp; Moses was a marvellous
man, a good man: Moses was a wonderful fellow, and did his duty, being
a married man: we lack such as Moses was.&nbsp; Well, I would all men
would look to their duty, as God hath called them, and then we should
have a flourishing christian commonweal.</p>
<p>And now I would ask a strange question: who is the most diligentest
bishop and prelate in all England, that passeth all the rest in doing
his office?&nbsp; I can tell, for I know him who it is; I know him well.&nbsp;
But now I think I see you listening and hearkening that I should name
him.&nbsp; There is one that passeth all the other, and is the most
diligent prelate and preacher in all England.&nbsp; And will ye know
who it is?&nbsp; I will tell you: it is the devil.&nbsp; He is the most
diligent preacher of all other; he is never out of his diocess; he is
never from his cure; ye shall never find him unoccupied; he is ever
in his parish; he keepeth residence at all times; ye shall never find
him out of the way, call for him when you will he is ever at home; the
diligentest preacher in all the realm; he is ever at his plough: no
lording nor loitering can hinder him; he is ever applying his business,
ye shall never find him idle, I warrant you.&nbsp; And his office is
to hinder religion, to maintain superstition, to set up idolatry, to
teach all kind of popery.&nbsp; He is ready as he can be wished for
to set forth his plough; to devise as many ways as can be to deface
and obscure God&rsquo;s glory.&nbsp; Where the devil is resident, and
hath his plough going, there away with books, and up with candles; away
with bibles, and up with beads; away with the light of the gospel, and
up with the light of candles, yea, at noon-days.&nbsp; Where the devil
is resident, that he may prevail, up with all superstition and idolatry;
censing, painting of images, candles, palms, ashes, holy water, and
new service of men&rsquo;s inventing; as though man could invent a better
way to honour God with than God himself hath appointed.&nbsp; Down with
Christ&rsquo;s cross, up with purgatory pick-purse, up with him, the
popish purgatory, I mean.&nbsp; Away with clothing the naked, the poor
and impotent; up with decking of images, and gay garnishing of stocks
and stones: up with man&rsquo;s traditions and his laws, down with God&rsquo;s
traditions and his most holy word.&nbsp; Down with the old honour due
to God, and up with the new god&rsquo;s honour.&nbsp; Let all things
be done in Latin: there must be nothing but Latin, not so much as <i>Memento,
homo, quod cinis es, et in cinerem reverteris</i>: &ldquo;Remember,
man, that thou art ashes, and into ashes thou shalt return:&rdquo; which
be the words that the minister speaketh unto the ignorant people, when
he giveth them ashes upon Ash-Wednesday; but it must be spoken in Latin:
God&rsquo;s word may in no wise be translated into English.</p>
<p>Oh that our prelates would be as diligent to sow the corn of good
doctrine, as Satan is to sow cockle and darnel!&nbsp; And this is the
devilish ploughing, the which worketh to have things in Latin, and letteth
the fruitful edification.&nbsp; But here some man will say to me, What,
sir, are ye so privy of the devil&rsquo;s counsel, that ye know all
this to be true?&nbsp; Truly I know him too well, and have obeyed him
a little too much in condescending to some follies; and I know him as
other men do, yea, that he is ever occupied, and ever busy in following
his plough.&nbsp; I know by St. Peter, which saith of him, <i>Sicut
leo rugiens circuit qu&aelig;rens quem devoret</i>: &ldquo;He goeth
about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I would have this text well viewed and examined, every word of it: &ldquo;<i>Circuit</i>,&rdquo;
he goeth about in every corner of his diocess; he goeth on visitation
daily, he leaveth no place of his cure unvisited: he walketh round about
from place to place, and ceaseth not.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Sicut leo</i>,&rdquo;
as a lion, that is, strongly, boldly, and proudly; stately and fiercely
with haughty looks, with his proud countenances, with his stately braggings.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Rugiens</i>,&rdquo; roaring; for he letteth not slip any occasion
to speak or to roar out when he seeth his time.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Qu&aelig;rens</i>,&rdquo;
he goeth about seeking, and not sleeping, as our bishops do; but he
seeketh diligently, he searcheth diligently all corners, where as he
may have his prey.&nbsp; He roveth abroad in every place of his diocess;
he standeth not still, he is never at rest, but ever in hand with his
plough, that it may go forward.&nbsp; But there was never such a preacher
in England as he is.&nbsp; Who is able to tell his diligent preaching,
which every day, and every hour, laboureth to sow cockle and darnel,
that he may bring out of form, and out of estimation and room, the institution
of the Lord&rsquo;s supper, and Christ&rsquo;s cross?&nbsp; For there
he lost his right; for Christ said, <i>Nunc judicium est mundi, princeps
seculi hujus ejicietur foras.&nbsp; Et sicut exaltarit Moses serpentem
in deserto, ita exaltari oportet Filium hominis.&nbsp; Et cum exaltatus
fuero a terra, omnia traham ad meipsum</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now is the
judgment of this world, and the prince of this world shall be cast out.&nbsp;
And as Moses did lift up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the
Son of man be lift up.&nbsp; And when I shall be lift up from the earth,
I will draw all things unto myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the devil was disappointed
of his purpose: for he thought all to be his own; and when he had once
brought Christ to the cross, he thought all cocksure.&nbsp; But there
lost he all reigning: for Christ said, <i>Omnia traham ad meipsum</i>:
&ldquo;I will draw all things to myself.&rdquo;&nbsp; He meaneth, drawing
of man&rsquo;s soul to salvation.&nbsp; And that he said he would do
<i>per semetipsum</i>, by his own self; not by any other body&rsquo;s
sacrifice.&nbsp; He meant by his own sacrifice on the cross, where he
offered himself for the redemption of mankind; and not the sacrifice
of the mass to be offered by another.&nbsp; For who can offer him but
himself?&nbsp; He was both the offerer and the offering.&nbsp; And this
is the prick, this is the mark at the which the devil shooteth, to evacuate
the cross of Christ, and to mingle the institution of the Lord&rsquo;s
supper; the which although he cannot bring to pass, yet he goeth about
by his sleights and subtil means to frustrate the same; and these fifteen
hundred years he hath been a doer, only purposing to evacuate Christ&rsquo;s
death, and to make it of small efficacy and virtue.&nbsp; For whereas
Christ, according as the serpent was lifted up in the wilderness, so
would he himself be exalted, that thereby as many as trusted in him
should have salvation; but the devil would none of that: they would
have us saved by a daily oblation propitiatory, by a sacrifice expiatory,
or remissory.</p>
<p>Now if I should preach in the country, among the unlearned, I would
tell what propitiatory, expiatory, and remissory is; but here is a learned
auditory: yet for them that be unlearned I will expound it.&nbsp; Propitiatory,
expiatory, remissory, or satisfactory, for they signify all one thing
in effect, and is nothing else but a thing whereby to obtain remission
of sins, and to have salvation.&nbsp; And this way the devil used to
evacuate the death of Christ, that we might have affiance in other things,
as in the sacrifice of the priest; whereas Christ would have us to trust
in his only sacrifice.&nbsp; So he was, <i>Agnus occisus ab origine
mundi</i>; &ldquo;The Lamb that hath been slain from the beginning of
the world;&rdquo; and therefore he is called <i>juge sacrificium</i>,
&ldquo;a continual sacrifice;&rdquo; and not for the continuance of
the mass, as the blanchers have blanched it, and wrested it; and as
I myself did once betake it.&nbsp; But Paul saith, <i>per semetipsum
purgatio facta</i>: &ldquo;By himself,&rdquo; and by none other, Christ
&ldquo;made purgation&rdquo; and satisfaction for the whole world.</p>
<p>Would Christ this word, &ldquo;by himself,&rdquo; had been better
weighed and looked upon, and <i>in sanctificationem</i>, to make them
holy; for he is <i>juge sacrificium</i>, &ldquo;a continual sacrifice,&rdquo;
in effect, fruit, and operation; that like as they, which seeing the
serpent hang up in the desert, were put in remembrance of Christ&rsquo;s
death, in whom as many as believed were saved; so all men that trusted
in the death of Christ shall be saved, as well they that were before,
as they that came after.&nbsp; For he was a continual sacrifice, as
I said, in effect, fruit, operation, and virtue; as though he had from
the beginning of the world, and continually should to the world&rsquo;s
end, hang still on the cross; and he is as fresh hanging on the cross
now, to them that believe and trust in him, as he was fifteen hundred
years ago, when he was crucified.</p>
<p>Then let us trust upon his only death, and look for none other sacrifice
propitiatory, than the same bloody sacrifice, the lively sacrifice;
and not the dry sacrifice, but a bloody sacrifice.&nbsp; For Christ
himself said, <i>consummatum est</i>: &ldquo;It is perfectly finished:
I have taken at my Father&rsquo;s hand the dispensation of redeeming
mankind, I have wrought man&rsquo;s redemption, and have despatched
the matter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why then mingle ye him?&nbsp; Why do ye divide
him?&nbsp; Why make you of him more sacrifices than one?&nbsp; Paul
saith, <i>Pascha nostrum immolatus est Christus</i>: &ldquo;Christ our
passover is offered;&rdquo; so that the thing is done, and Christ hath
done it <i>semel</i>, once for all; and it was a bloody sacrifice, not
a dry sacrifice.&nbsp; Why then, it is not the mass that availeth or
profiteth for the quick and the dead.</p>
<p>Wo worth thee, O devil, wo worth thee, that hast prevailed so far
and so long; that hast made England to worship false gods, forsaking
Christ their Lord.&nbsp; Wo worth thee, devil, wo worth thee, devil,
and all thy angels.&nbsp; If Christ by his death draweth all things
to himself, and draweth all men to salvation, and to heavenly bliss,
that trust in him; then the priests at the mass, at the popish mass,
I say, what can they draw, when Christ draweth all, but lands and goods
from the right heirs?&nbsp; The priests draw goods and riches, benefices
and promotions to themselves; and such as believed in their sacrifices
they draw to the devil.&nbsp; But Christ is he that draweth souls unto
him by his bloody sacrifice.&nbsp; What have we to do then but <i>epulari
in Domino</i>, to eat in the Lord at his supper?&nbsp; What other service
have we to do to him, and what other sacrifice have we to offer, but
the mortification of our flesh?&nbsp; What other oblation have we to
make, but of obedience, of good living, of good works, and of helping
our neighbours?&nbsp; But as for our redemption, it is done already,
it cannot be better: Christ hath done that thing so well, that it cannot
be amended.&nbsp; It cannot be devised how to make that any better than
he hath done it.&nbsp; But the devil, by the help of that Italian bishop
yonder, his chaplain, hath laboured by all means that he might to frustrate
the death of Christ and the merits of his passion.&nbsp; And they have
devised for that purpose to make us believe in other vain things by
his pardons; as to have remission of sins for praying on hallowed beads;
for drinking of the bakehouse bowl; as a canon of Waltham Abbey once
told me, that whensoever they put their loaves of bread into the oven,
as many as drank of the pardon-bowl should have pardon for drinking
of it.&nbsp; A mad thing, to give pardon to a bowl!&nbsp; Then to pope
Alexander&rsquo;s holy water, to hallowed bells, palms, candles, ashes,
and what not?&nbsp; And of these things, every one hath taken away some
part of Christ&rsquo;s sanctification; every one hath robbed some part
of Christ&rsquo;s passion and cross, and hath mingled Christ&rsquo;s
death, and hath been made to be propitiatory and satisfactory, and to
put away sin.&nbsp; Yea, and Alexander&rsquo;s holy water yet at this
day remaineth in England, and is used for a remedy against spirits and
to chase away devils; yea, and I would this had been the worst.&nbsp;
I would this were the worst.&nbsp; But wo worth thee, O devil, that
has prevailed to evacuate Christ&rsquo;s cross, and to mingle the Lord&rsquo;s
supper.&nbsp; These be the Italian bishop&rsquo;s devices, and the devil
hath pricked at this mark to frustrate the cross of Christ: he shot
at this mark long before Christ came, he shot at it four thousand years
before Christ hanged on the cross, or suffered his passion.</p>
<p>For the brasen serpent was set up in the wilderness, to put men in
remembrance of Christ&rsquo;s coming; that like as they which beheld
the brasen serpent were healed of their bodily diseases, so they that
looked spiritually upon Christ that was to come, in him should be saved
spiritually from the devil.&nbsp; The serpent was set up in memory of
Christ to come; but the devil found means to steal away the memory of
Christ&rsquo;s coining, and brought the people to worship the serpent
itself, and to cense him, to honour him, and to offer to him, to worship
him, and to make an idol of him.&nbsp; And this was done by the market-men
that I told you of.&nbsp; And the clerk of the market did it for the
lucre and advantage of his master, that thereby his honour might increase;
for by Christ&rsquo;s death he could have but small worldly advantage.&nbsp;
And so even now so hath he certain blanchers belonging to the market,
to let and stop the light of the gospel, and to hinder the king&rsquo;s
proceedings in setting forth the word and glory of God.&nbsp; And when
the king&rsquo;s majesty, with the advice of his honourable council,
goeth about to promote God&rsquo;s word, and to set an order in matters
of religion, there shall not lack blanchers that will say, &ldquo;As
for images, whereas they have used to be censed, and to have candles
offered unto to them, none be so foolish to do it to the stock or stone,
or to the image itself; but it is done to God and his honour before
the image.&rdquo;&nbsp; And though they should abuse it, these blanchers
will be ready to whisper the king in the ear, and to tell him, that
this abuse is but a small matter; and that the same, with all other
like abuses in the church, may be reformed easily.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
but a little abuse,&rdquo; say they, &ldquo;and it may be easily amended.&nbsp;
But it should not be taken in hand at the first, for fear of trouble
or further inconveniences.&nbsp; The people will not bear sudden alterations;
an insurrection may be made after sudden mutation, which may be to the
great harm and loss of the realm.&nbsp; Therefore all things shall be
well, but not out of hand, for fear of further business.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These be the blanchers, that hitherto have stopped the word of God,
and hindered the true setting forth of the same.&nbsp; There be so many
put-offs, so many put-byes, so many respects and considerations of worldly
wisdom: and I doubt not but there were blanchers in the old time to
whisper in the ear of good king Hezekiah, for the maintenance of idolatry
done to the brasen serpent, as well as there hath been now of late,
and be now, that can blanch the abuse of images, and other like things.&nbsp;
But good king Hezekiah would not be so blinded; he was like to Apollos,
&ldquo;fervent in spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would give no ear to the blanchers;
he was not moved with the worldly respects, with these prudent considerations,
with these policies: he feared not insurrections of the people: he feared
not lest his people would bear not the glory of God; but he, without
any of these respects, or policies, or considerations, like a good king,
for God&rsquo;s sake and for conscience sake, by and by plucked down
the brasen serpent, and destroyed it utterly, and beat it to powder.&nbsp;
He out of hand did cast out all images, he destroyed all idolatry, and
clearly did extirpate all superstition.&nbsp; He would not hear these
blanchers and worldly-wise men, but without delay followeth God&rsquo;s
cause, and destroyeth all idolatry out of hand.&nbsp; Thus did good
king Hezekiah; for he was like Apollos, fervent in spirit, and diligent,
to promote God&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<p>And good hope there is, that it shall be likewise here in England;
for the king&rsquo;s majesty is so brought up in knowledge, virtue,
and godliness, that it is not to be mistrusted but that we shall have
all things well, and that the glory of God shall be spread abroad throughout
all parts of the realm, if the prelates will diligently apply their
plough, and be preachers rather than lords.&nbsp; But our blanchers,
which will be lords, and no labourers, when they are commanded to go
and be resident upon their cures, and preach in their benefices, they
would say, &ldquo;What?&nbsp; I have set a deputy there; I have a deputy
that looketh well to my flock, and the which shall discharge my duty.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;A deputy,&rdquo; quoth he!&nbsp; I looked for that word all this
while.&nbsp; And what a deputy must he be, trow ye?&nbsp; Even one like
himself: he must be a canonist; that is to say, one that is brought
up in the study of the pope&rsquo;s laws and decrees; one that will
set forth papistry as well as himself will do; and one that will maintain
all superstition and idolatry; and one that will nothing at all, or
else very weakly, resist the devil&rsquo;s plough: yea, happy it is
if he take no part with the devil; and where he should be an enemy to
him, it is well if he take not the devil&rsquo;s part against Christ.</p>
<p>But in the meantime the prelates take their pleasures.&nbsp; They
are lords, and no labourers: but the devil is diligent at his plough.&nbsp;
He is no unpreaching prelate: he is no lordly loiterer from his cure,
but a busy ploughman; so that among all the prelates, and among all
the pack of them that have cure, the devil shall go for my money, for
he still applieth his business.&nbsp; Therefore, ye unpreaching prelates,
learn of the devil: to be diligent in doing of your office, learn of
the devil: and if you will not learn of God, nor good men, for shame
learn of the devil; <i>ad erubescentiam vestrum dico</i>, &ldquo;I speak
it for your shame:&rdquo; if you will not learn of God, nor good men,
to be diligent in your office, learn of the devil.&nbsp; Howbeit there
is now very good hope that the king&rsquo;s majesty, being of the help
of good governance of his most honourable counsellors trained and brought
up in learning, and knowledge of God&rsquo;s word, will shortly provide
a remedy, and set an order herein; which thing that it may so be, let
us pray for him.&nbsp; Pray for him, good people; pray for him.&nbsp;
Ye have great cause and need to pray for him.</p>
<h2>A SERMON ON THE PARABLE OF A KING THAT MARRIED HIS SON, MADE BY
MASTER LATIMER.</h2>
<blockquote><p>MATTHEW XXII. [2,3.]</p>
<p><i>Simile factum est regnum coelorum homini regi qui fecit nuptias
filio suo</i>.</p>
<p>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which married
his son, and sent forth his servants to call them that, &amp;c.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a gospel that containeth very much matter; and there is another
like unto this in the fourteenth of Luke: but they be both one in effect,
for they teach both one thing; and therefore I will take them both in
hand together, because they tend to one purpose.&nbsp; Matthew saith,
&ldquo;The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which married
his son;&rdquo; Luke saith, &ldquo;A certain man ordained a great supper:&rdquo;
but there is no difference in the very substance of the matter, for
they pertain to one purpose.&nbsp; Here is made mention of a feast-maker:
therefore we must consider who was the feast-maker: secondarily, who
was his son: thirdly, we must consider to whom he was married: fourthly,
who were they that called the guests: fifthly, who were the guests.&nbsp;
And then we must know how the guest-callers behaved themselves: and
then, how the guests behaved themselves towards them that called them.&nbsp;
When all these circumstances be considered, we shall find much good
matters covered and hid in this gospel.</p>
<p>Now that I may so handle these matters, that it may turn to the edification
of your souls, and to the discharge of my office, I will most instantly
desire you to lift up your hearts unto God, and desire his divine Majesty,
in the name of his only-begotten Son, our Saviour Jesus Christ, that
he will give unto us his Holy Ghost:&mdash;unto me, that I may speak
the word of God, and teach you to understand the same; unto you, that
you may hear it fruitfully, to the edification of your souls; so that
you may be edified through it, and your lives reformed and amended;
and that his honour and glory may increase daily amongst us.&nbsp; Wherefore
I shall desire you to say with me, &ldquo;Our Father,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>Dearly beloved in the Lord, the gospel that is read this day is a
parable, a similitude or comparison.&nbsp; For our Saviour compared
the kingdom of God unto a man that made a marriage for his son.&nbsp;
And here was a marriage.&nbsp; At a marriage, you know, there is commonly
great feastings.&nbsp; Now you must know who was this feast-maker, and
who was his son, and to whom he was married; and who were those that
should be called, and who were the callers; how they behaved themselves,
and how the guests behaved themselves towards them that called them.</p>
<p>Now this marriage-maker, or feast-maker, is Almighty God.&nbsp; Luke
the Evangelist calleth him a man, saying, &ldquo;A certain man ordained
a great supper.&rdquo;&nbsp; He calleth him a man, not that he was incarnate,
or hath taken our flesh upon him: no, not so; for you must understand
that there be three Persons in the Deity, God the Father, God the Son,
and God the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; And these three Persons decked the Son
with manhood; so that neither the Father, neither the Holy Ghost, took
flesh upon them, but only the Son; he took our flesh upon him, taking
it of the Virgin Mary.&nbsp; But Luke called God the Father a man, not
because he took flesh upon him, but only compared him unto a man; not
that he will affirm him to be a man.&nbsp; Who was he now that was married?&nbsp;
Who was the bridegroom?&nbsp; Marry, that was our Saviour Jesus Christ,
the second person in the Deity; the eternal Son of God.&nbsp; Who should
be his spouse?&nbsp; To whom was he married?&nbsp; To his church and
congregation: for he would have all the world to come unto him, and
to be married unto him: but we see by daily experience that the most
part refuse his offer.&nbsp; But here is shewed the state of the church
of God: for this marriage, this feast, was begun at the beginning of
the world, and shall endure to the end of the same: yet for all that,
the most part refused it: for at the very beginning of the world, ever
the most part refused to come.&nbsp; And so it appeareth at this time,
how little a number cometh to this wedding and feast: though we have
callers, yet there be but few of those that come.&nbsp; So ye hear that
God is the feast-maker; the bridegroom is Christ, his Son, our Saviour;
the bride is the congregation.</p>
<p>Now what manner of meat was prepared at this great feast?&nbsp; For
ye know it is commonly seen, that at a marriage the finest meat is prepared
that can be gotten.&nbsp; What was the chiefest dish at this great banquet?&nbsp;
What was the feast-dish?&nbsp; Marry, it was the bridegroom himself:
for the Father, the feast-maker, prepared none other manner of meat
for the guests, but the body and blood of his own natural Son.&nbsp;
And this is the chiefest dish at this banquet; which truly is a marvellous
thing, that the Father offereth his Son to be eaten.&nbsp; Verily, I
think that no man hath heard the like.&nbsp; And truly there was never
such kind of feasting as this is, where the Father will have his Son
to be eaten, and his blood to be drunk.</p>
<p>We read in a story, that a certain man had eaten his son; but it
was done unawares: he knew not that it was his son, else no doubt he
would not have eaten him.&nbsp; The story is this: There was a king
named Astyages, which had heard by a prophecy, that one Cyrus should
have the rule and dominion over his realm after his departure; which
thing troubled the said king very sore, and therefore [he] sought all
the ways and means how to get the said Cyrus out of the way; how to
kill him, so that he should not be king after him.&nbsp; Now he had
a nobleman in his house, named Harpagus, whom he appointed to destroy
the said Cyrus: but howsoever the matter went, Cyrus was preserved and
kept alive, contrary to the king&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; Which thing when
Astyages heard, what doth he?&nbsp; This he did: Harpagus, that nobleman
which was put in trust to kill Cyrus, had a son in the court, whom the
king commanded to be taken; his head, hands, and feet to be cut off;
and his body to be prepared, roasted, or sodden, of the best manner
as could be devised.&nbsp; After that, he biddeth Harpagus to come and
eat with him, where there was jolly cheer; one dish coming after another.&nbsp;
At length the king asked him, &ldquo;Sir, how liketh you your fare?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Harpagus thanketh the king, with much praising the king&rsquo;s banquet.&nbsp;
Now the king perceiving him to be merrily disposed, commanded one of
his servants to bring in the head, hands, and feet of Harpagus&rsquo;s
son.&nbsp; When it was done, the king showed him what manner of meat
he had eaten, asking him how it liketh him.&nbsp; Harpagus made answer,
though with an heavy heart, <i>Quod regi placet, id mihi quoque placet</i>;
&ldquo;Whatsoever pleaseth the king, that also pleaseth me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And here we have an ensample of a flatterer, or dissembler: for this
Harpagus spake against his own heart and conscience.&nbsp; Surely, I
fear me, there be a great many of flatterers in our time also, which
will not be ashamed to speak against their own heart and consciences,
like as this Harpagus did; which had, no doubt, a heavy heart, and in
his conscience the act of the king misliked him, yet for all that, with
his tongue he praised the same.&nbsp; So I say, we read not in any story,
that at any time any father had eaten his son willingly and wittingly;
and this Harpagus, of whom I rehearsed the story, did it unawares.&nbsp;
But the Almighty God, which prepared this feast for all the world, for
all those that will come unto it, he offereth his only Son to be eaten,
and his blood to be drunken.&nbsp; Belike he loved his guests well,
because he did feed them with so costly a dish.</p>
<p>Again, our Saviour, the bridegroom, offereth himself at his last
supper, which he had with his disciples, his body to be eaten, and his
blood to be drunk.&nbsp; And to the intent that it should be done to
our great comfort; and then again to take away all cruelty, irksomeness,
and horribleness, he sheweth unto us how we shall eat him, in what manner
and form; namely, spiritually, to our great comfort: so that whosoever
eateth the mystical bread, and drinketh the mystical wine worthily,
according to the ordinance of Christ, he receiveth surely the very body
and blood of Christ spiritually, as it shall be most comfortable unto
his soul.&nbsp; He eateth with the mouth of his soul, and digesteth
with the stomach of his soul, the body of Christ.&nbsp; And to be short:
whosoever believeth in Christ, putteth his hope, trust, and confidence
in him, he eateth and drinketh him: for the spiritual eating is the
right eating to everlasting life; not the corporal eating, as the Capernaites
understood it.&nbsp; For that same corporal eating, on which they set
their minds, hath no commodities at all; it is a spiritual meat that
feedeth our souls.</p>
<p>But I pray you, how much is this supper of Christ regarded amongst
us, where he himself exhibiteth unto us his body and blood?&nbsp; How
much, I say, is it regarded?&nbsp; How many receive it with the curate
or minister?&nbsp; O Lord, how blind and dull are we to such things,
which pertain to our salvation!&nbsp; But I pray you, wherefore was
it ordained principally?&nbsp; Answer: it was ordained for our help,
to help our memory withal; to put us in mind of the great goodness of
God, in redeeming us from everlasting death by the blood of our Saviour
Christ; yea, and to signify unto us, that his body and blood is our
meat and drink for our souls, to feed them to everlasting life.&nbsp;
If we were now so perfect as we ought to be, we should not have need
of it: but to help our imperfectness it was ordained of Christ; for
we be so forgetful, when we be not pricked forward, we have soon forgotten
all his benefits.&nbsp; Therefore to the intent that we might better
keep it in memory, and to remedy this our slothfulness, our Saviour
hath ordained this his supper for us, whereby we should remember his
great goodness, his bitter passion and death, and so strengthen our
faith: so that he instituted this supper for our sake, to make us to
keep in fresh memory his inestimable benefits.&nbsp; But, as I said
before, it is in a manner nothing regarded amongst us: we care not for
it; we will not come unto it.&nbsp; How many be there, think ye, which
regard this supper of the Lord as much as a testoon?&nbsp; But very
few, no doubt of it: and I will prove that they regard it not so much.&nbsp;
If there were a proclamation made in this town, that whosoever would
come unto the church at such an hour, and there go to the communion
with the curate, should have a testoon; when such a proclamation were
made, I think, truly, all the town would come and celebrate the communion
to get a testoon: but they will not come to receive the body and blood
of Christ, the food and nourishment of their souls, to the augmentation
and strength of their faith!&nbsp; Do they not more regard now a testoon
than Christ?&nbsp; But the cause which letteth us from celebrating of
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, is this: we have no mind nor purpose to leave
sin and wickedness, which maketh us not to come to this supper, because
we be not ready nor meet to receive it.&nbsp; But I require you in God&rsquo;s
behalf; leave your wickedness, that ye may receive it worthily, according
to his institution.&nbsp; For this supper is ordained, as I told you
before, for our sake, to our profits and commodities: for if we were
perfect, we should not need this outward sacrament; but our Saviour,
knowing our weakness and forgetfulness, ordained this supper to the
augmentation of our faith, and to put us in remembrance of his benefits.&nbsp;
But we will not come: there come no more at once, but such as give the
holy loaves from house to house; which follow rather the custom than
any thing else.&nbsp; Our Saviour Christ saith in the gospel of St.
John, <i>Ego sum panis virus, qui de coelo descendi</i>; &ldquo;I am
the living bread which came down from heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore
whosoever feedeth of our Saviour Christ, he shall not perish; death
shall not prevail against him: his soul shall depart out of his body,
yet death shall not get the victory over him; he shall not be damned.&nbsp;
He that cometh to that marriage, to that banquet, death shall be unto
him but an entrance or a door to everlasting life.&nbsp; <i>Panis quem
ego dabo caro mea est</i>; &ldquo;The bread that I will give is my flesh,
which I will give for the life of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; As many as
will feed upon him, shall attain to everlasting life: they shall never
die; they shall prevail against death; death shall not hurt them, because
he hath lost his strength.&nbsp; If we would consider this, no doubt
we would be more desirous to come to the communion than we be; we would
not be so cold; we would be content to leave our naughty living, and
come to the Lord&rsquo;s table.</p>
<p>Now ye have heard what shall be the chiefest dish at this marriage,
namely, the body and blood of Christ.&nbsp; But now there be other dishes,
which be sequels or hangings-on, wherewith the chief dish is powdered:
that is, remission of sins; also the Holy Ghost, which ruleth and governeth
our hearts; also the merits of Christ, which are made ours.&nbsp; For
when we feed upon this dish worthily, then we shall have remission of
our sins; we shall receive the Holy Ghost.&nbsp; Moreover, all the merits
of Christ are ours; his fulfilling of the law is ours; and so we be
justified before God, and finally attain to everlasting life.&nbsp;
As many, therefore, as feed worthily of this dish, shall have all these
things with it, and in the end everlasting life.&nbsp; St. Paul saith,
<i>Qui proprio Filio suo non pepercit, sed pro nobis omnibus tradidit
illum, quomodo non etiam cum illo omnia nobis donabit</i>?&nbsp; &ldquo;He
which spared not his own Son, but gave him for us all, how shall he
not with him give us all things also?&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore they that
be in Christ are partakers of all his merits and benefits; of everlasting
life, and of all felicity.&nbsp; He that hath Christ hath all things
that are Christ&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He is our preservation from damnation;
he is our comfort; he is our help, our remedy.&nbsp; When we feed upon
him, then we shall have remission of our sins: the same remission of
sins is the greatest and most comfortable thing that can be in the world.&nbsp;
O what a comfortable thing is this, when Christ saith, <i>Remittuntur
tibi peccata</i>, &ldquo;Thy sins are forgiven unto thee!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And this is a standing sentence; it was not spoken only to the same
one man, but it is a general proclamation unto all us: all and every
one that believeth in him shall have forgiveness of their sins.&nbsp;
And this proclamation is cried out daily by his ministers and preachers;
which proclamation is the word of grace, the word of comfort and consolation.&nbsp;
For like as sin is the most fearful and the most horriblest thing in
heaven and in earth, so the most comfortablest thing is the remedy against
sin; which remedy is declared and offered unto us in this word of grace
and the power to distribute this remedy against sins he hath given unto
his ministers, which be God&rsquo;s treasurers, distributers of the
word of God.&nbsp; For now he speaketh by me, he calleth you to this
wedding by me, being but a poor man; yet he hath sent me to call you.&nbsp;
And though he be the author of the word, yet he will have men to be
called through his ministers to that word.&nbsp; Therefore let us give
credit unto the minister, when he speaketh God&rsquo;s word: yea, rather
let us credit God when he speaketh by his ministers, and offereth us
remission of our sins by his word.&nbsp; For there is no sin so great
in this world, but it is pardonable as long as we be in this world,
and call for mercy: for here is the time of mercy; here we may come
to forgiveness of our sins.&nbsp; But if we once die in our sins and
wickedness, so that we be damned, let us not look for remission afterwards:
for the state after this life is unchangeable.&nbsp; But as long as
we be here, we may cry for mercy.&nbsp; Therefore let us not despair:
let us amend our lives, and cry unto God for forgiveness of our sins;
and then no doubt we shall obtain remission, if we call with a faithful
heart upon him, for so he hath promised unto us in his most holy word.</p>
<p>The holy scripture maketh mention of a sin against the Holy Ghost,
which sin cannot be forgiven, neither in this world, nor in the world
to come.&nbsp; And this maketh many men unquiet in their hearts and
consciences: for some there be which ever be afraid, lest they have
committed that same sin against the Holy Ghost, which is irremissible.&nbsp;
Therefore some say, &ldquo;I cannot tell whether I have sinned against
the Holy Ghost or not: if I have committed that sin, I know I shall
be damned.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I tell you what ye shall do: despair not
of the mercy of God, for it is immeasurable.&nbsp; I cannot deny but
that there is a sin against the Holy Ghost, which is irremissible: but
we cannot judge of it aforehand, we cannot tell which man hath committed
that sin or not, as long as he is alive; but when he is once gone, then
I can judge whether he sinned against the Holy Ghost or not.&nbsp; As
now I can judge that Nero, Saul, and Judas, and such like, that died
in sins and wickedness, did commit this sin against the Holy Ghost:
for they were wicked, and continued in their wickedness still to the
very end; they made an end in their wickedness.&nbsp; But we cannot
judge whether one of us sin this sin against the Holy Ghost, or not;
for though a man be wicked at this time, yet he may repent, and leave
his wickedness tomorrow, and so not commit that sin against the Holy
Ghost.&nbsp; Our Saviour Christ pronounced against the scribes and Pharisees,
that they had committed that sin against the Holy Ghost; because he
knew their hearts, he knew they would still abide in their wickedness
to the very end of their lives.&nbsp; But we cannot pronounce this sentence
against any man, for we know not the hearts of men: he that sinneth
now, peradventure shall be turned tomorrow, and leave his sins, and
so be saved.&nbsp; Further, the promises of our Saviour Christ are general;
they pertain to all mankind: he made a general proclamation, saying,
<i>Qui credit in me, habet vitam &aelig;ternam</i>; &ldquo;Whosoever
believeth in me hath everlasting life.&rdquo;&nbsp; Likewise St. Paul
saith, <i>Gratia exsuperat supra peccatum</i>; &ldquo;The grace and
mercies of God exceedeth far our sins.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore let us
ever think and believe that the grace of God, his mercy and goodness,
exceedeth our sins.&nbsp; Also consider what Christ saith with his own
mouth: <i>Venite ad me, omnes qui laboratis, &amp;c</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
unto me, all ye that labour and are laden, and I will ease you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mark, here he saith, &ldquo;Come all ye:&rdquo; wherefore then should
any body despair, or shut out himself from these promises of Christ,
which be general, and pertain to the whole world?&nbsp; For he saith,
&ldquo;Come all unto me.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then again he saith, <i>Refocillabo
vos</i>, &ldquo;I will refresh you:&rdquo; you shall be eased from the
burdens of your sins.&nbsp; Therefore, as I said before, he that is
blasphemous, and obstinately wicked, and abideth in his wickedness still
to the very end, he sinneth against the Holy Ghost; as St. Augustine,
and all other godly writers do affirm.&nbsp; But he that leaveth his
wickedness and sins, is content to amend his life, and then believing
in Christ, seeketh salvation and everlasting life by him, no doubt that
man or woman, whosoever he or they be, shall be saved: for they feed
upon Christ, upon that meat that God the Father, this feast-maker, hath
prepared for all his guests.</p>
<p>You have heard now who is the maker of this feast or banquet: and
again, you have heard what meat is prepared for the guests; what a costly
dish the house-father hath ordained at the wedding of his son.&nbsp;
But now ye know, that where there be great dishes and delicate fare,
there be commonly prepared certain sauces, which shall give men a great
lust and appetite to their meats; as mustard, vinegar, and such like
sauces.&nbsp; So this feast, this costly dish, hath its sauces; but
what be they?&nbsp; Marry, the cross, affliction, tribulation, persecution,
and all manner of miseries: for, like as sauces make lusty the stomach
to receive meat, so affliction stirreth up in us a desire to Christ.&nbsp;
For when we be in quietness, we are not hungry, we care not for Christ:
but when we be in tribulation, and cast in prison, then we have a desire
to him; then we learn to call upon him; then we hunger and thirst after
him; then we are desirous to feed upon him.&nbsp; As long as we be in
health and prosperity, we care not for him; we be slothful, we have
no stomach at all; and therefore these sauces are very necessary for
us.&nbsp; We have a common saying amongst us, when we see a fellow sturdy,
lofty, and proud, men say, &ldquo;This is a saucy fellow;&rdquo; signifying
him to be a high-minded fellow, which taketh more upon him than he ought
to do, or his estate requireth: which thing, no doubt, is naught and
ill; for every one ought to behave himself according unto his calling
and estate.&nbsp; But he that will be a christian man, that intendeth
to come to heaven, must be a saucy fellow; he must be well powdered
with the sauce of affliction, and tribulation; not with proudness and
stoutness, but with miseries and calamities: for so it is written, <i>Omnes
qui pie volunt vivere in Christo persecutionem patientur</i>; &ldquo;Whosoever
will live godly in Christ, he shall have persecution and miseries:&rdquo;
he shall have sauce enough to his meat.&nbsp; Again, our Saviour saith,
<i>Qui vult meus esse discipulus, abneget semetipsum et tollat crucem
suam et sequatur me</i>; &ldquo;He that will be my disciple must deny
himself and take his cross upon him, and follow me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Is
there any man that will feed upon me, that will eat my flesh and drink
my blood?&nbsp; Let him forsake himself.&nbsp; O this is a great matter;
this is a biting thing, the denying of my own will!&rsquo; As for an
ensample: I see a fair woman, and conceive in my heart an ill appetite
to commit lechery with her; I desire to fulfil my wanton lust with her.&nbsp;
Here is my appetite, my lust, my will: but what must I do?&nbsp; Marry,
I must deny myself, and follow Christ.&nbsp; What is that?&nbsp; I must
not follow my own desire, but the will and pleasure of Christ.&nbsp;
Now what saith he?&nbsp; <i>Non fornicaberis, non adulteraberis</i>;
&ldquo;Thou shalt not be a whoremonger, thou shalt not be a wedlock-breaker.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here I must deny myself, and my will, and give place unto his will;
abhor and hate my own will.&nbsp; Yea, and furthermore I must earnestly
call upon him, that he will give me grace to withstand my own lust and
appetite, in all manner of things which may be against his will: as
when a man doth me wrong, taketh my living from me, or hurteth me in
my good name and fame, my will is to avenge myself upon him, to do him
a foul turn again; but what saith God?&nbsp; <i>Mihi vindicta, ego retribuam</i>;
&ldquo;Unto me belongeth vengeance, I will recompense the same.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Now here I must give over my own will and pleasure, and obey his will:
this I must do, if I will feed upon him, if I will come to heaven.&nbsp;
But this is a bitter thing, a sour sauce, a sharp sauce; this sauce
maketh a stomach: for when I am injured or wronged, or am in other tribulation,
then I have a great desire for him, to feed upon him, to be delivered
from trouble, and to attain to quietness and joy.</p>
<p>There is a learned man which hath a saying which is most true: he
saith, <i>Plus crux quam tranquillitas invitat ad Christum</i>; &ldquo;The
cross and persecution bring us sooner to Christ than prosperity and
wealth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore St. Peter saith, <i>Humiliamini sub potenti
manu Dei</i>; &ldquo;Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Look, what God layeth upon you, bear it willingly and humbly.&nbsp;
But you will say, &ldquo;I pray you, tell me what is my cross?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Answer: This that God layeth upon you, that same is your cross; not
that which you of your own wilfulness lay upon yourselves: as there
was a certain sect which were called Flagellarii, which scourged themselves
with whips till the blood ran from their bodies; this was a cross, but
it was not the cross of God.&nbsp; No, no: he laid not that upon them,
they did it of their own head.&nbsp; Therefore look, what God layeth
upon me, that same is my cross, which I ought to take in good part;
as when I fall in poverty, or in miseries, I ought to be content withal;
when my neighbour doth me wrong, taketh away my goods, robbeth me of
my good name and fame, I shall bear it willingly, considering that it
is God&rsquo;s cross, and that nothing can be done against me without
his permission.&nbsp; There falleth never a sparrow to the ground without
his permission; yea, not a hair falleth from our head without his will.&nbsp;
Seeing then that there is nothing done without his will, I ought to
bear this cross which he layeth upon me willingly, without any murmuring
or grudging.</p>
<p>But I pray you, consider these words of St. Peter well: <i>Humiliamini
sub potenti manu Dei</i>; &ldquo;Humble yourselves under the mighty
hand of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here St. Peter signifieth unto us that God
is a mighty God, which can take away the cross from us when it seemeth
him good; yea, and he can send patience in the midst of all trouble
and miseries.&nbsp; St. Paul, that elect instrument of God, shewed a
reason wherefore God layeth afflictions upon us, saying: <i>Corripimur
a Domino, ne cum mundo condemnemur</i>; &ldquo;We are chastened of the
Lord, lest we should be condemned with the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; For you
see by daily experience, that the most part of wicked men are lucky
in this world; they bear the swing, all things goeth after their minds;
for God letteth them have their pleasures here.&nbsp; And therefore
this is a common saying, &ldquo;The more wicked, the more lucky:&rdquo;
but they that pertain to God, that shall inherit everlasting life, they
must go to the pot; they must suffer here, according to that scripture,
<i>Judicium a domo Dei incipit</i>; &ldquo;The judgment of God beginneth
at the house of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore it cometh of the goodness
of God, when we be put to taste the sauce of tribulation: for he doth
it to a good end, namely, that we should not be condemned with this
wicked world.&nbsp; For these sauces are very good for us; for they
make us more hungry and lusty to come to Christ and feed upon him.&nbsp;
And truly, when it goeth well with us, we forget Christ, our hearts
and minds are not upon him: therefore it is better to have affliction
than to be in prosperity.&nbsp; For there is a common saying, <i>Vexatio
dat intellectum</i>; &ldquo;Vexation giveth understanding.&rdquo;&nbsp;
David, that excellent king and prophet, saith, <i>Bonum est mihi quod
humiliasti me, Domine</i>: &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; saith he, &ldquo;it is
good for me that thou hast pulled down my stomach, that thou hast humbled
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I pray you, what sauce had David, how was he humbled?&nbsp;
Truly thus: his own son defiled his daughter.&nbsp; After that, Absalom,
one other of his sons, killed his own brother.&nbsp; And this was not
enough, but his own son rose up against him, and traitorously cast him
out of his kingdom, and defiled his wives in the sight of all the people.&nbsp;
Was not he vexed? had he not sauces?&nbsp; Yes, yes: yet for all that
he cried not out against God; he murmured not, but saith, <i>Bonum est
mihi quod humiliasti me</i>; &ldquo;Lord, it is good for me that thou
hast humbled me, that thou hast brought me low.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore
when we be in trouble, let us be of good comfort, knowing that God doth
it for the best.&nbsp; But for all that, the devil, that old serpent,
the enemy of mankind, doth what he can day and night to bring us this
sauce, to cast us into persecution, or other miseries: as it appeareth
in the gospel of Matthew, where our Saviour casting him out of a man,
seeing that he could do no more harm, he desired Christ to give him
leave to go into the swine; and so he cast them all into the sea.&nbsp;
Where it appeareth, that the devil studieth and seeketh all manner of
ways to hurt us, either in soul, or else in body.&nbsp; But for all
that, let us not despair, but rather lift up our hearts unto God, desiring
his help and comfort; and no doubt, when we do so, he will help: he
will either take away the calamities, or else mitigate them, or at the
leastwise send patience into our hearts, that we may bear it willingly.</p>
<p>Now you know, at a great feast, when there is made a delicate dinner,
and the guests fare well, at the end of the dinner they have <i>bellaria</i>,
certain subtleties, custards, sweet and delicate things: so when we
come to this dinner, to this wedding, and feed upon Christ, and take
his sauces which he hath prepared for us, at the end cometh the sweetmeat.&nbsp;
What is that?&nbsp; Marry, remission of sins, and everlasting life;
such joy, that no tongue can express, nor heart can think, which God
hath prepared for all them that come to this dinner, and feed upon his
Son, and taste of his sauces.&nbsp; And this is the end of this banquet.&nbsp;
This banquet, or marriage-dinner, was made at the very beginning of
the world.&nbsp; God made this marriage in paradise, and called the
whole world unto it, saying, <i>Semen mulieris conteret caput serpentis</i>;
&ldquo;The Seed of the woman shall vanquish the head of the serpent.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was the first calling; and this calling stood unto the faithful
in as good stead as it doth unto us, which have a more manifest calling.&nbsp;
Afterward Almighty God called again with these words, speaking to Abraham:
<i>Ego ero Deus tuus et seminis tui post te</i>; &ldquo;I will be thy
God, and thy seed&rsquo;s after thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now what is it to
be our God?&nbsp; Forsooth to be our defender, our comforter, our deliverer,
and helper.&nbsp; Who was Abraham&rsquo;s seed?&nbsp; Even Christ the
Son of God, he was Abraham&rsquo;s seed: in him, and through him, all
the world shall be blessed; all that believe in him, all that come to
this dinner, and feed upon him.&nbsp; After that, all the prophets,
their only intent was to call the people to this wedding.&nbsp; Now
after the time was expired which God had appointed, he said, <i>Venite,
parata sunt omnia</i>; &ldquo;Come, all things are ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But who are these callers?&nbsp; The first was John Baptist, which
not only called with his mouth, but also shewed with his finger that
meat which God had prepared for the whole world.&nbsp; He saith, <i>Ecce
Agnus Dei qui tollit peccata mundi</i>; &ldquo;Lo, the Lamb of God,
that taketh away the sins of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Also Christ himself
called, saying, <i>Venite ad me, omnes qui laboratis</i>; &ldquo;Come
to me, all ye that travail and labour, and I will refresh you.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Likewise the apostles cried, and called all the whole world; as it is
written, <i>Exivit sonus eorum per universam terram</i>; &ldquo;Their
sound is gone throughout all the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, I pray you,
what thanks had they for their calling, for their labour?&nbsp; Verily
this: John Baptist was beheaded; Christ was crucified; the apostles
were killed: this was their reward for their labours.&nbsp; So all the
preachers shall look for none other reward: for no doubt they must be
sufferers, they must taste of these sauces: their office is, <i>arguere
mundum de peccato</i>, &ldquo;to rebuke the world of sin;&rdquo; which
no doubt is a thankless occupation.&nbsp; <i>Ut audiant montes judicia
Domini</i>, &ldquo;That the high hills,&rdquo; that is, great princes
and lords, &ldquo;may hear the judgments of the Lord:&rdquo; they must
spare no body; they must rebuke high and low, when they do amiss; they
must strike them with the sword of God&rsquo;s word: which no doubt
is a thankless occupation; yet it must be done, for God will have it
so.</p>
<p>There be many men, which be not so cruel as to persecute or to kill
the preachers of God&rsquo;s word; but when they be called to feed upon
Christ, to come to this banquet, to leave their wicked livings, then
they begin to make their excuses; as it appeared here in this gospel,
where &ldquo;the first said, I have bought a farm, and I must needs
go and see it; I pray thee have me excused.&nbsp; Another said, I have
bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me
excused.&nbsp; The third said, I have married a wife, and therefore
I cannot come.&rdquo;&nbsp; And these were their excuses.&nbsp; You
must take heed that you mistake not this text: for after the outward
letter it seemeth as though no husbandman, no buyer or seller, nor married
man shall enter the kingdom of God.&nbsp; Therefore ye must take heed
that ye understand it aright.&nbsp; For to be a husbandman, to be a
buyer or seller, to be a married man, is a good thing, and allowed of
God: but the abuse of such things is reproved.&nbsp; Husbandman, and
married man, every one in his calling, may use and do the works of his
calling.&nbsp; The husbandman may go to plough; they may buy and sell;
also, men may marry; but they may not set their hearts upon it.&nbsp;
The husbandman may not so apply his husbandry to set aside the hearing
of the word of God; for when he doth so, he sinneth damnably: for he
more regardeth his husbandry than God and his word; he hath all lust
and pleasure in his husbandry, which pleasure is naught.&nbsp; As there
be many husbandmen which will not come to service; they make their excuses
that they have other business: but this excusing is naught; for commonly
they go about wicked matters, and yet they would excuse themselves,
to make themselves faultless; or, at the least way, they will diminish
their faults, which thing itself is a great wickedness; to do wickedly,
and then to defend that same wickedness, to neglect and despise God&rsquo;s
word, and then to excuse such doings, like as these men do here in this
gospel.&nbsp; The husbandman saith, &ldquo;I have bought a farm; therefore
have me excused: the other saith, I have bought five yoke of oxen; I
pray thee have me excused:&rdquo;&nbsp; Now when he cometh to the married
man, that same fellow saith not, &ldquo;Have me excused,&rdquo; as the
others say; but he only saith, &ldquo;I cannot come.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where
it is to be noted, that the affections of carnal lusts and concupiscence
are the strongest above all the other: for there be some men which set
all their hearts upon voluptuousness; they regard nothing else, neither
God nor his word; and therefore this married man saith, &ldquo;I cannot
come;&rdquo; because his affections are more strong and more vehement
than the other men&rsquo;s were.</p>
<p>But what shall be their reward which refuse to come?&nbsp; The house-father
saith, &ldquo;I say unto you, that none of those men which were bidden
shall taste of my supper.&rdquo;&nbsp; With these words Christ our Saviour
teacheth us, that all those that love better worldly things than God
and his word shall be shut out from his supper; that is to say, from
everlasting joy and felicity: for it is a great matter to despise God&rsquo;s
word, or the minister of the same; for the office of preaching is the
office of salvation; it hath warrants in scripture, it is grounded upon
God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp; St. Paul to the Romans maketh a gradation of
such-wise: <i>Omnis quicunque invocaverit nomen Domini salvabitur: quomodo
ergo invocabunt in quem non crediderunt, aut quomodo credent ei quem
non audisrunt</i>? that is to say, &ldquo;Whosoever shall call on the
name of the Lord, shall be saved: but how shall they call upon him,
in whom they believe not?&nbsp; How shall they believe on him of whom
they have not heard?&nbsp; How shall they hear without a preacher?&nbsp;
And how shall they preach, except they be sent?&rdquo;&nbsp; At the
length he concludeth, saying, <i>Fides ex auditu</i>; &ldquo;Faith cometh
by hearing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where ye may perceive, how necessary a thing
it is to hear God&rsquo;s word, and how needful a thing it is to have
preachers, which may teach us the word of God: for by hearing we must
come to faith; through faith we must be justified.&nbsp; And therefore
Christ saith himself, <i>Qui credit in me, habet vitam &aelig;ternam</i>;
&ldquo;He that believeth in me hath everlasting life.&rdquo;&nbsp; When
we hear God&rsquo;s word by the preacher, and believe that same, then
we shall be saved: for St. Paul saith, <i>Evangelium est potentia Dei
ad salutem omni credenti</i>; &ldquo;The gospel is the power of God
unto salvation to all that believe; the gospel preached is God&rsquo;s
power to salvation of all believers.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a great commendation
of this office of preaching: therefore we ought not to despise it, or
little regard it; for it is God&rsquo;s instrument, whereby he worketh
faith in our hearts.&nbsp; Our Saviour saith to Nicodeme, <i>Nisi quis
renatus fuerit</i>, &ldquo;Except a man be born anew, he cannot see
the kingdom of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; But how cometh this regeneration?&nbsp;
By hearing and believing of the word of God: for so saith St. Peter,
<i>Renati non ex semine mortali corruptibili</i>; &ldquo;We are born
anew, not of mortal seed, but of immortal, by the word of God.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Likewise Paul saith in another place, <i>Visum est Deo per stultitiam
pr&aelig;dicationis salvos facere credentes</i>; &ldquo;It pleased God
to save the believers through the foolishness of preaching.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But, peradventure, you will say, &ldquo;What, shall a preacher teach
foolishness?&rdquo;&nbsp; No, not so: the preacher, when he is a right
preacher, he preacheth not foolishness, but he preacheth the word of
God; but it is taken for foolishness, the world esteemeth it for a trifle:
but howsoever the world esteemeth it, St. Paul saith that God will save
his through it.</p>
<p>Here I might take occasion to inveigh against those which little
regard the office of preaching; which are wont to say, &ldquo;&lsquo;What
need we such preachings every day?&nbsp; Have I not five wits?&nbsp;
I know as well what is good or ill, as he doth that preacheth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But I tell thee, my friend, be not too hasty; for when thou hast nothing
to follow but thy five wits, thou shalt go to the devil with them.&nbsp;
David, that holy prophet, said not so: he trusted not his five wits,
but he said, <i>Lucerna pedibus meis verbum tuum, Domine</i>; &ldquo;Lord,
thy word is a lantern unto my feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here we learn not to
despise the word of God, but highly to esteem it, and reverently to
hear it; for the holy day is ordained and appointed to none other thing,
but that we should at that day hear the word of God, and exercise ourselves
in all godliness.&nbsp; But there be some which think that this day
is ordained only for feasting, drinking, or gaming, or such foolishness;
but they be much deceived: this day was appointed of God that we should
hear his word, and learn his laws, and so serve him.&nbsp; But I dare
say the devil hath no days so much service as upon Sundays or holy days;
which Sundays are appointed to preaching, and to hear God&rsquo;s most
holy word.&nbsp; Therefore God saith not only in his commandments, that
we shall abstain from working; but he saith, <i>Sanctificabis</i>, &ldquo;Thou
shalt hallow:&rdquo; so that holy day keeping is nothing else but to
abstain from good works, and to do better works; that is, to come together,
and celebrate the Communion together, and visit the sick bodies.&nbsp;
These are holy-day works; and for that end God commanded us to abstain
from bodily works, that we might be more meet and apt to do those works
which he hath appointed unto us, namely, to feed our souls with his
word, to remember his benefits, and to give him thanks, and to call
upon him.&nbsp; So that the holy-day may be called a marriage-day, wherein
we are married unto God; which day is very needful to be kept.&nbsp;
The foolish common people think it to be a belly-cheer day, and so they
make it a surfeiting day: there is no wickedness, no rebellion, no lechery,
but she hath most commonly her beginning upon the holy-day.</p>
<p>We read a story in the fifteenth chapter of the book of Numbers,
that there was a fellow which gathered sticks upon the sabbath-day;
he was a despiser of God&rsquo;s ordinances and laws, like as they that
now-a-days go about other business, when they should hear the word of
God, and come to the Common Prayer: which fellows truly have need of
sauce, to be made more lustier to come and feed upon Christ than they
be.&nbsp; Now Moses and the people consulted with the Lord, what they
should do, how they should punish that fellow which had so transgressed
the sabbath-day.&nbsp; &ldquo;He shall die,&rdquo; saith God: which
thing is an ensample for us to take heed, that we transgress not the
law of the sabbath-day.&nbsp; For though God punish us not by and by,
as this man was punished; yet he is the very self-same God that he was
before, and will punish one day, either here, or else in the other world,
where the punishment shall be everlasting.</p>
<p>Likewise in the seventeenth chapter of the prophet Jeremy God threateneth
his fearful wrath and anger unto those which do profane his sabbath-day.&nbsp;
Again, he promiseth his favour and all prosperity to them that will
keep the holy-days; saying, &ldquo;Princes and kings shall go through
thy gates,&rdquo; that is to say, Thou shalt be in prosperity, in wealth,
and great estimation amongst thy neighbours.&nbsp; Again: &ldquo;If
ye will not keep my sabbath-day, I will kindle a fire in your gates;&rdquo;
that is to say, I will destroy you, I will bring you to nought, and
burn your cities with fire.&nbsp; These words pertain as well unto us
at this time, as they pertained to them at their time: for God hateth
the disallowing of the sabbath as well now as then; for he is and remaineth
still the old God: he will have us to keep his sabbath, as well now
as then: for upon the sabbath-day God&rsquo;s seed-plough goeth; that
is to say, the ministry of his word is executed; for the ministering
of God&rsquo;s word is God&rsquo;s plough.&nbsp; Now upon the Sundays
God sendeth his husbandmen to come and till; he sendeth his callers
to come and call to the wedding, to bid the guests; that is, all the
world to come to that supper.&nbsp; Therefore, for the reverence of
God, consider these things: consider who calleth, namely, God; consider
again who be the guests; all ye.&nbsp; Therefore I call you in God&rsquo;s
name, come to this supper; hallow the sabbath-day; that is, do your
holy-day work, come to this supper; for this day was appointed of God
to that end, that his word should be taught and heard.&nbsp; Prefer
not your own business therefore before the hearing of the word of God.&nbsp;
Remember the story of that man which gathered sticks upon the holy day,
and was put to death by the consent of God: where God shewed himself
not a cruel God, but he would give warning unto the whole world by that
man, that all the world should keep holy his sabbath-day.</p>
<p>The almighty ever-living God give us grace to live so in this miserable
world, that we may at the end come to the great sabbath-day, where there
shall be everlasting joy and gladness!&nbsp; <i>Amen</i>.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
